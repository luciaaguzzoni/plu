1
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:34,286
The oceans, seemingly limitless,

2
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:39,958
invoke in us a sense of awe and wonder
and also sometimes fear.

3
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:44,129
They cover 70% of the surface
of our planet,

4
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:48,050
and yet they are still
the least explored.

5
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:53,805
Hidden beneath the waves
right beneath my feet,

6
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:57,476
there are creatures
beyond our imagination.

7
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:17,496
<i>With revolutionary technology,
we can enter new worlds...</i>

8
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,671
<i>...and shine a light on behaviours</i>

9
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:29,049
<i>in ways that were impossible
just a generation ago.</i>

10
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,014
We've also recognised
an uncomfortable fact.

11
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:39,017
The health of our oceans
is under threat.

12
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:43,272
They're changing at a faster rate
than ever before in human history.

13
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:53,073
<i>Never has there been a more crucial time</i>

14
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:57,786
<i>to reveal what is going on
beneath the surface of the seas.</i>

15
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:15,554
<i>In this first episode,</i>

16
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:22,769
<i>we will journey across the globe
from the warm waters of the tropics</i>

17
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,900
<i>to the coldest around the poles.</i>

18
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:38,243
<i>To bring us a new understanding
of live beneath the waves.</i>

19
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,586
<i>This is Blue Planet H.</i>

20
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:54,361
<i>The surface of the ocean conceals
the many creatures that live beneath</i>

21
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:09,751
<i>but not all.</i>

22
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,423
<i>Bottlenose dolphins.</i>

23
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:20,512
<i>They're extremely intelligent.</i>

24
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:35,026
<i>And with this intelligence
comes playfulness.</i>

25
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,618
<i>They surf.</i>

26
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:50,542
<i>And as far as we can tell,
they do so for the sheer joy of it.</i>

27
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:22,657
<i>But to properly appreciate
their true character,</i>

28
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:28,455
<i>you have to travel with them
into their world.</i>

29
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,599
<i>A pod of bottlenose dolphins is visiting
a coral reef in the Red Sea.</i>

30
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:53,688
<i>For the youngsters,
there are things to be learned here.</i>

31
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:08,286
The adults lead a calf
to a particular bush-like coral

32
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:11,122
<i>called a Gorgonian.</i>

33
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:28,974
<i>And here, the adults behave
rather strangely.</i>

34
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:39,025
<i>They deliberately rub themselves
through the fronds.</i>

35
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:55,667
<i>Their calf seems reluctant to do so.</i>

36
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:10,265
<i>By watching his elders,</i>

37
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:14,519
<i>he may be realising
that this is something he ought to do.</i>

38
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:25,447
<i>Gorgonia fronds, in fact,
are covered with a mucous</i>

39
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:30,368
<i>that can have anti-inflammatory
and antimicrobial properties.</i>

40
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,251
<i>So maybe the adult dolphins
are doing this</i>

41
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,545
<i>to protect themselves from infection.</i>

42
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:54,059
<i>The dolphins' intimate knowledge
of the reef</i>

43
00:07:56,227 --> 00:08:00,774
<i>is spurring us to search
for new medicines here, too.</i>

44
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,118
<i>Tropical coral reefs</i>

45
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:16,498
<i>occupy only a tenth of one percent
of the ocean floor.</i>

46
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:23,838
<i>But their shallow warm waters
and stable year round conditions,</i>

47
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:27,676
<i>support some of the most crowded
and varied communities</i>

48
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,470
<i>to be found anywhere in the oceans.</i>

49
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:37,811
<i>And there are new discoveries to be made
on every one of them.</i>

50
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:03,002
<i>One creature
on Australia's Great Barrier Reef</i>

51
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:07,674
<i>is challenging our understanding
of fish intelligence.</i>

52
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:09,801
<i>A tusk fish.</i>

53
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,971
<i>And you can see why it gets its name.</i>

54
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,647
<i>He does something
few would have believed a fish could do.</i>

55
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:33,658
<i>Every morning,
he travels to the edge of the reef.</i>

56
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,384
<i>He's searching
for something special to eat</i>

57
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,053
<i>amongst the coral and sand.</i>

58
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:07,066
<i>Here's one.</i>

59
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:10,862
<i>A small clam.</i>

60
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:22,040
<i>But how to crack it open
and get to the meat?</i>

61
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,929
<i>He takes it all the way back</i>

62
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,723
<i>to his special kitchen.</i>

63
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,734
<i>A bowl-shaped coral</i>

64
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:55,073
<i>that has a particular bump on the inside
that he always uses.</i>

65
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:16,761
<i>It's not easy if you have no hands.</i>

66
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,437
<i>Whoops.</i>

67
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,023
<i>There he goes again.</i>

68
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,114
<i>But he's got great determination</i>

69
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,789
<i>and surprising accuracy.</i>

70
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:06,519
<i>At last.</i>

71
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:12,859
<i>So here is a fish that uses tools.</i>

72
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:19,490
<i>Some fish are much cleverer
than you might suppose.</i>

73
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,345
<i>The density of the animals
on tropical reefs</i>

74
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:44,098
<i>makes competition
inevitable and extreme.</i>

75
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,519
<i>Not only for those that lived
within the reef,</i>

76
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:52,398
<i>but for the birds that fly above them.</i>

77
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:57,695
<i>During the dry season,</i>

78
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:00,281
<i>over half a million terns</i>

79
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:04,035
<i>crowd onto this remote atoll
in the Indian Ocean.</i>

80
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,922
<i>Their chicks are still
in their dark, juvenile plumage.</i>

81
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,595
<i>They vary in age.</i>

82
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:34,774
<i>Whilst the more advanced chicks
take to the air,</i>

83
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,826
<i>others aren't quite ready yet.</i>

84
00:14:06,264 --> 00:14:08,933
<i>Those just starting to learn to fly</i>

85
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:12,979
<i>use the shallow lagoon
that occupies the centre of the atoll</i>

86
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:14,856
<i>as their training ground.</i>

87
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:21,362
<i>It's difficult for some of them
to stay aloft for long.</i>

88
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,014
<i>Giant trevallies.</i>

89
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:04,739
<i>Usually, they're solitary hunters,</i>

90
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:09,160
<i>but about 50 of them have come here
from neighbouring reefs</i>

91
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,872
<i>attracted by this abundance
of potential prey.</i>

92
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:24,425
<i>The fledglings stay out of the water
if they can,</i>

93
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,554
<i>they even drink on the wing.</i>

94
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:49,617
<i>If the trevally are to catch one now,</i>

95
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,703
<i>they have to up their game.</i>

96
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:06,134
<i>So there is a fish here that amazingly</i>

97
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:10,471
<i>has a brain capable of calculating
the airspeed,</i>

98
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:13,891
<i>altitude and trajectory of a bird.</i>

99
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:50,678
<i>The time comes when every fledgling
has to take to the air</i>

100
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,930
<i>and collect food for itself.</i>

101
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:21,375
<i>Their parents lead them
to the training grounds.</i>

102
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,976
<i>If they're to survive,</i>

103
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,312
<i>they must learn quickly.</i>

104
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:16,449
<i>After a month of practising
over the lagoon,</i>

105
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,492
<i>the youngsters start to leave</i>

106
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:21,746
<i>and take their chances
out over the open sea.</i>

107
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:35,134
<i>The oceans hold 97% of all the water
in the world.</i>

108
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,682
<i>As the sun warms their surface,
water evaporates.</i>

109
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,852
<i>The vapour rises into the sky</i>

110
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:48,939
<i>until it cools and condenses
into towering clouds.</i>

111
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:55,279
<i>And they generate huge storms.</i>

112
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:02,745
<i>The spin of the earth
deflects these storms</i>

113
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:06,165
<i>north and south into cooler latitudes.</i>

114
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,176
<i>As they travel across the sea,</i>

115
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:21,639
<i>storm-driven winds create huge swells.</i>

116
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,821
<i>When the swells reach shallower waters,</i>

117
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,699
<i>they rise into gigantic waves.</i>

118
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:03,347
<i>In its lifetime,
a large storm can release energy</i>

119
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:07,685
<i>that is the equivalent
of 70, 000 nuclear bombs.</i>

120
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,464
<i>These are the seasonal seas.</i>

121
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,469
<i>And when they warm in spring,</i>

122
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,722
<i>they can suddenly explode with life.</i>

123
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:04,450
<i>Mobula rays have gathered
in Mexico's Sea of Cortez</i>

124
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,327
<i>in vast numbers.</i>

125
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,461
<i>Why do they leap?</i>

126
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,758
<i>Is it to tell others that they're here?</i>

127
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:25,930
<i>No one knows.</i>

128
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:32,102
<i>They feed mostly at night</i>

129
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:37,441
<i>for that is when vast swarms
of plankton rise from the depths.</i>

130
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:48,452
<i>The disturbance in the water stimulates
many of the planktonic creatures</i>

131
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,204
<i>to luminesce.</i>

132
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,961
<i>Only now do we have the technology
to record their faint glow.</i>

133
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:08,931
<i>The feasting rays swim through them</i>

134
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:13,644
<i>creating an extraordinary ballet
of life and death.</i>

135
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:08,532
<i>The richness of these waters
is based on microscopic plants,</i>

136
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,367
<i>Phytoplankton,</i>

137
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:15,205
<i>which bloom on such a massive scale
they benefit us all.</i>

138
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:22,212
<i>They, together with seaweeds
and sea grasses,</i>

139
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,214
<i>produce as much oxygen</i>

140
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,385
<i>as all the forests
and grassy plains on land.</i>

141
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,524
<i>Every spring off New Zealand,</i>

142
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:46,487
<i>the seasonal bounty
draws in rare visitors.</i>

143
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,414
<i>False killer whales.</i>

144
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,128
<i>They're relatives of the orca,</i>

145
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:06,590
<i>six metres long
and weighing over a tonne.</i>

146
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,186
<i>They appear to be searching
for dolphins.</i>

147
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:25,693
<i>And there are many
in these coastal waters.</i>

148
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:38,455
<i>Here, bottlenose dolphins stick together</i>

149
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,834
<i>constantly chattering
with whistles and clicks.</i>

150
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:55,222
<i>Such a din carries for miles underwater.</i>

151
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:04,231
<i>The false killers have detected them.</i>

152
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,259
<i>Travelling at ten knots,
the killers quickly close in on them.</i>

153
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:54,948
<i>But then,
something truly extraordinary happens.</i>

154
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,873
<i>The dolphins turn</i>

155
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:07,044
<i>as if to greet their pursuers.</i>

156
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,888
<i>They seem to change their course.</i>

157
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:23,393
<i>Could it be that they're attempting
to communicate?</i>

158
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,406
<i>Scientists studying
this annual encounter,</i>

159
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,494
<i>now think that individuals
may recognise one another.</i>

160
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:48,210
<i>Almost unbelievably,
it seems that these different species</i>

161
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,420
<i>appear to be old friends.</i>

162
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:01,849
<i>Together they're gathering
as one unified army</i>

163
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:03,976
<i>up to a thousand strong.</i>

164
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:16,488
<i>This formidable hunting party
now harvests the riches</i>

165
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,949
<i>that come with New Zealand's summer.</i>

166
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:45,183
<i>All across the higher latitudes,</i>

167
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:49,313
<i>seasonal seas flourish
under the summer sun.</i>

168
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:56,194
<i>Here in Alaska,
sea otters lounge in the canopy</i>

169
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,822
<i>of great submarine forests.</i>

170
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:13,420
<i>Giant kelp, the biggest seaweed of all
is home to all kinds of life.</i>

171
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,509
<i>On the forest floor, spiny
sea urchins munch through the kelp.</i>

172
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:25,849
<i>Elsewhere there are continuously hungry
sea cucumbers</i>

173
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,688
<i>And in the tangled undergrowth,</i>

174
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:35,359
<i>wonderfully camouflaged sea dragons.</i>

175
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:49,915
<i>In the underwater forests
of northern Japan,</i>

176
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,168
<i>the residents of this sunken wreck</i>

177
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:58,548
<i>are waiting for the summer temperatures
to reach 16 degrees Celsius.</i>

178
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:14,898
<i>That for some is the time for mating.</i>

179
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:32,416
<i>A kind of giant wrasse called a Kobudai.</i>

180
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,466
<i>This is a male.</i>

181
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:50,475
<i>And in female terms,
he's particularly handsome.</i>

182
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:03,155
<i>He's a metre long and weighs 15 kilos.</i>

183
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:09,453
<i>Much larger than the diminutive female,</i>

184
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:15,959
<i>and he is ready to breed.</i>

185
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,964
<i>He attempts to mate with her</i>

186
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,887
<i>and with any of the dozen or so females
that live in his territory,</i>

187
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,515
<i>whenever he gets the chance.</i>

188
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,867
<i>But females from around ten years old</i>

189
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:52,162
<i>take little notice of his advances.</i>

190
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:25,695
<i>This is because when any large female
reaches a critical body size,</i>

191
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,741
<i>she can begin a dramatic transformation.</i>

192
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,886
<i>Over just a few months,</i>

193
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,391
<i>particular enzymes inside her body
cease to work,</i>

194
00:32:56,476 --> 00:33:00,272
<i>and male hormones start to circulate.</i>

195
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,111
<i>As time passes,</i>

196
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,156
<i>her head expands</i>

197
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,908
<i>and her chin gets longer.</i>

198
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:19,124
<i>A she has changed into a he.</i>

199
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,012
<i>And with this comes a change
in temperament.</i>

200
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,105
<i>The old male who rules
all the females here</i>

201
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:46,943
<i>is challenged to a face off.</i>

202
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,619
<i>The more bulbous the head,</i>

203
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,331
<i>the more it intimidates an opponent.</i>

204
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,903
<i>The territory has a new ruler.</i>

205
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:47,212
<i>Only the largest females transform
themselves in this way.</i>

206
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:56,596
<i>But the change enables them
to have more mates,</i>

207
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:01,059
<i>so they will have many more offspring
carrying their genes.</i>

208
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:10,026
<i>But a new male can't afford
to be complacent.</i>

209
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,366
<i>Inside the body of every Kobudai female,</i>

210
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:20,120
<i>there is a new male in waiting.</i>

211
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:45,562
<i>The closer we travel towards the poles,
the colder the seas become.</i>

212
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:50,900
<i>Icebergs appear.</i>

213
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,820
<i>Huge slabs that have broken away</i>

214
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,072
<i>from glaciers that are sliding
into the sea.</i>

215
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:01,619
<i>And then the surface starts to freeze.</i>

216
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:15,592
<i>While the lights of the aurora
play above,</i>

217
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,761
<i>even in the depths of midwinter,</i>

218
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:22,015
<i>there are a few places
well north of the Arctic circle</i>

219
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,641
<i>that are still open.</i>

220
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:39,074
<i>The fjords of northern Norway
remain ice free</i>

221
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:42,160
<i>because a giant current,
the Gulf Stream,</i>

222
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,204
<i>flows up here from the south</i>

223
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:47,540
<i>bringing warmth all the way
from the Caribbean.</i>

224
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,129
<i>And every winter,</i>

225
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:56,716
<i>billions of herring
come here for shelter.</i>

226
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:02,597
<i>And following them...</i>

227
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:06,518
<i>...Orca.</i>

228
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,491
<i>There are up to a thousand of them.</i>

229
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:27,705
<i>It's possibly the greatest gathering
of orca on the planet.</i>

230
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:42,303
<i>The herring maybe plentiful
but in these winding fjords</i>

231
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:45,265
<i>they're not always easy to track down.</i>

232
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,230
<i>These particular orca, however,</i>

233
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:55,191
<i>are fish hunting specialists.</i>

234
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:05,910
<i>They work as a team,</i>

235
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:10,707
<i>coordinating their approach
by calling loudly to one another.</i>

236
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:19,799
<i>They herd the herring
into tighter and tighter shoals.</i>

237
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,025
<i>They swim below them,</i>

238
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:39,736
<i>trapping them against
the surface of the sea.</i>

239
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:52,832
<i>And now the orca deploy
their special weapon.</i>

240
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,424
<i>They beat their tails with such force,</i>

241
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:04,469
<i>that the shock waves stun the herring.</i>

242
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:11,518
<i>And then the senseless victims
are easily collected.</i>

243
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,974
<i>But all this underwater noise
attracts others.</i>

244
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:00,984
<i>Humpback whales.</i>

245
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:05,154
<i>They move in on the action.</i>

246
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,001
<i>They approach the shoal from beneath
and then lunge upwards,</i>

247
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:29,178
<i>gathering up to a hundred kilos
of herring in a single mouthful.</i>

248
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:51,743
<i>The humpbacks are comparative newcomers.</i>

249
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:56,205
<i>They only started coming here
within the last decade.</i>

250
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:10,762
<i>But these polars seas are so rich</i>

251
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:13,806
<i>that there appears to be enough food
for everyone.</i>

252
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:40,416
<i>Nonetheless, few if any of these riches</i>

253
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,087
<i>would be here were it not
for the Gulf Stream.</i>

254
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:58,434
<i>Ocean currents, in fact, are crucial
to the well being of our planet.</i>

255
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:06,859
<i>They distribute the sun's heat
towards the poles</i>

256
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,611
<i>all the way from the equator,</i>

257
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,827
<i>maintaining a climate favourable
for life almost everywhere.</i>

258
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,962
<i>From creating the weather
to producing oxygen,</i>

259
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:28,965
<i>the seas keep our world healthy.</i>

260
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:41,060
<i>But there are now worrying signs</i>

261
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:42,812
<i>that conditions in the oceans</i>

262
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:45,815
<i>that have remained relatively stable
for millennia</i>

263
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:48,151
<i>are changing radically.</i>

264
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,740
<i>Nowhere is this more evident
than in the Arctic.</i>

265
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,161
<i>Here in the past 30 years,</i>

266
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:03,040
<i>the extent of the ice in summer
has been reduced by 40%.</i>

267
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,002
<i>This sudden warming,</i>

268
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:09,088
<i>most likely a consequence
of human activity,</i>

269
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:13,342
<i>is having a profound impact
on its wildlife.</i>

270
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:24,645
<i>Walruses are among those
that are seriously affected.</i>

271
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:38,534
<i>Every adult female
needs to find a safe place</i>

272
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,704
<i>where her 80-kilo pup can rest.</i>

273
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,375
<i>The sea ice is retreating</i>

274
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:49,212
<i>from much
of the walrus' traditional range,</i>

275
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,715
<i>so they now have
to haul out on dry land.</i>

276
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:01,849
<i>But a herd of hundreds
of quarrelsome mothers,</i>

277
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:06,145
<i>some weighing almost a tonne,
is not an ideal nursery.</i>

278
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:19,659
<i>Walruses on land stick together
for good reason.</i>

279
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:23,329
<i>Polar bears.</i>

280
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,379
<i>A full grown male walrus is gigantic,</i>

281
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:34,340
<i>too big for even a polar bear to tackle.</i>

282
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:39,929
<i>So the bear is looking
for a walrus baby.</i>

283
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:49,689
<i>The scent of the bear
spreads alarm through the colony.</i>

284
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,866
<i>The walruses retreat into the sea.</i>

285
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:22,305
<i>The bear knows it won't be able
to catch them there.</i>

286
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:35,484
<i>But she too has young ones to feed.</i>

287
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:46,162
<i>What is a mother to do?</i>

288
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:59,550
<i>A mother walrus still needs
to find a place</i>

289
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,344
<i>where her young can rest.</i>

290
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:11,687
<i>A melting iceberg might do,</i>

291
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:16,359
<i>but she is not the first
to find this one.</i>

292
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,203
<i>Suitable places are already taken.</i>

293
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:04,615
<i>Other mothers don't want to share.</i>

294
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,249
<i>They, too, need a patch of ice
where they can protect their young.</i>

295
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:24,635
<i>A desperate mother has no choice
but to barge her way in.</i>

296
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:51,787
<i>So this time everyone loses.</i>

297
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:21,317
<i>Finding the right place
on these melting shores</i>

298
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:24,403
<i>gets harder and harder.</i>

299
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:06,487
<i>Solving these problems together
helps create a bond so strong</i>

300
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:11,450
<i>that the mother will stay in contact
with her young for the rest of her life.</i>

301
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:27,299
<i>But who knows now
what their future will be.</i>

302
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,151
<i>As we understand more
about the complexity</i>

303
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:47,736
<i>of the lives of sea creatures,</i>

304
00:49:49,113 --> 00:49:53,409
<i>so we begin to appreciate
the fragility of their home.</i>
