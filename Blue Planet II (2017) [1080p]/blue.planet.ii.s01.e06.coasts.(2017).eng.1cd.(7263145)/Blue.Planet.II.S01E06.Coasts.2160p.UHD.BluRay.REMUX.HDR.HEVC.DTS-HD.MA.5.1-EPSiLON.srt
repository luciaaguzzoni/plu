1
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:45,631
<i>An olive ridley turtle.</i>

2
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:52,512
<i>She's resting in the shallows
off Costa Rica,</i>

3
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:58,518
<i>having swum a thousand miles to be here.</i>

4
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:15,202
<i>All because the eggs she carries
must be laid on dry land.</i>

5
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,879
<i>Now she's returned
to the very same beach</i>

6
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:28,840
<i>where she hatched 10 years ago.</i>

7
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:42,020
<i>She must leave the safety
of her marine world</i>

8
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:48,235
<i>and brave the alien world beyond.</i>

9
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:15,262
<i>She's heavily laden</i>

10
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:20,309
<i>but the future of the next generation
of her kind is at stake.</i>

11
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:32,988
<i>All along the beach in a spectacle
that has remained unchanged</i>

12
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,781
<i>for millions or years,</i>

13
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:38,910
<i>mother sea turtles emerge from the ocean</i>

14
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,666
<i>in their hundreds of thousands.</i>

15
00:02:57,304 --> 00:03:00,974
<i>Only those animals
that overcome the great challenges</i>

16
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,143
<i>of both land and sea</i>

17
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:07,439
<i>can make the most of life
here on the coast.</i>

18
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:39,888
<i>Our shores are places of sudden changes
and rich rewards.</i>

19
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:48,355
<i>The Galapagos Islands
in the tropical Pacific Ocean.</i>

20
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:56,154
<i>Their barren coastline
looks inhospitable,</i>

21
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:01,159
<i>but one group of animals has learnt
to use it to their advantage.</i>

22
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:15,006
<i>Sea lions.</i>

23
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:20,679
<i>Bachelors.</i>

24
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,933
<i>They need to pile on the pounds</i>

25
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:29,396
<i>as only the biggest males will attract
a female and manage to breed.</i>

26
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,363
<i>If these young bulls
fail to grow big enough,</i>

27
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,368
<i>they will remain exiled
on this isolated shoreline.</i>

28
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:55,380
<i>So one hungry young bull
heads out alone.</i>

29
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,915
<i>He's on the hunt for big game.</i>

30
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,008
<i>Yellowfin tuna.</i>

31
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,181
<i>Each weighing 60 kilos</i>

32
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:51,811
<i>with a top speed of 40 miles an hour.</i>

33
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:58,860
<i>He can't possibly catch one
in the open sea,</i>

34
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:02,781
<i>but he has a plan.</i>

35
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:08,662
<i>Ahead lies the entrance to the cove.</i>

36
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,125
<i>He herds them towards it</i>

37
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,802
<i>into his trap.</i>

38
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:42,487
<i>Driving them into a dead end.</i>

39
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,161
<i>But they give him the slip.</i>

40
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,255
<i>He's failed.</i>

41
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:13,685
<i>But there might be another way.</i>

42
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,540
<i>Now they head off as a team</i>

43
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:41,463
<i>to round up more tuna,</i>

44
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,094
<i>driving them back into the cove.</i>

45
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:07,447
<i>The sea lions fan out channelling
the tuna towards the bottleneck.</i>

46
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,260
<i>Once again the tuna hit the dead end.</i>

47
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:33,056
<i>But this time,
the young bull doubles back</i>

48
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:36,768
<i>to act as a blocker
sealing off the exit.</i>

49
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,964
<i>This time when the shoal
tries to escape,</i>

50
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,218
<i>he blocks them and drives them back
into the next blind alley.</i>

51
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,361
<i>The gang can now pick them off
one by one.</i>

52
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,536
<i>This clever fishing technique,</i>

53
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,373
<i>demanding foresight,
planning and cooperation,</i>

54
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:26,419
<i>has only every been seen here
in the Galapagos.</i>

55
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:34,052
<i>Each massive fish provides them
with five times more protein</i>

56
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,970
<i>than a normal day's hunting.</i>

57
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,437
<i>Finally, the young bull leaves his post</i>

58
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,651
<i>to claim his reward.</i>

59
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,086
<i>On a diet of protein-rich tuna,</i>

60
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:12,507
<i>he's well on the way to becoming
a full-sized breeding bull.</i>

61
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,183
<i>By using this cove,</i>

62
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:26,855
<i>these Galapagos sea lions
have made the most of the opportunities</i>

63
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:30,775
<i>that occur
where the coast's two worlds meet.</i>

64
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:45,206
<i>Coasts are the most swiftly changing
of all ocean habitats</i>

65
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,043
<i>because of the tides.</i>

66
00:11:57,385 --> 00:12:02,724
<i>Tides are created as the moon's gravity
pulls at the sea.</i>

67
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:18,573
<i>As the moon circles our planet,
the seas rise and fall.</i>

68
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,160
<i>Typically twice a day,</i>

69
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,583
<i>creating the most constantly dynamic
landscapes on Earth.</i>

70
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:44,849
<i>Nowhere else do sea-living creatures
face such changeable conditions.</i>

71
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,899
<i>With the daily risk of drying out
and being scorched by the sun.</i>

72
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:02,784
<i>Where the tide retreats
across a rocky shore,</i>

73
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:06,704
<i>it can leave behind a temporary oasis.</i>

74
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,214
<i>A rock pool.</i>

75
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,979
<i>Seemingly, it's a haven of calm.</i>

76
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,066
<i>But not for long.</i>

77
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:42,115
<i>Turning minutes into seconds
reveals unexpected dramas.</i>

78
00:13:55,837 --> 00:14:00,550
<i>In rock pools, grazers, scavengers
and filter feeders</i>

79
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,469
<i>must all make the most
of the few short hours</i>

80
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,430
<i>before the tide returns.</i>

81
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:26,284
<i>Anemones gulp down
anything they can reach.</i>

82
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:32,290
<i>Though some meals
are harder to digest than others.</i>

83
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:46,637
<i>These magical worlds
soon become battlegrounds.</i>

84
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:56,355
<i>A deadly predator with five arms
and on the underside a mouth.</i>

85
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,903
<i>The ochre starfish.</i>

86
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,660
<i>And it's in search of limpets.</i>

87
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,266
<i>For some, there is no escape.</i>

88
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:46,197
<i>But other limpets have a secret defence.</i>

89
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,744
<i>They deploy a slippery shield</i>

90
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:57,416
<i>which allows them to slide to safety.</i>

91
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:06,425
<i>And this limpet
has its own personal bodyguard.</i>

92
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:19,230
<i>A scale worm with a nasty nip.</i>

93
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:29,657
<i>The starfish prefers food
that doesn't bite back.</i>

94
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:32,702
<i>The limpet carries on,</i>

95
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:36,622
<i>its bodyguard
tucked safe under its shell.</i>

96
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,586
<i>But there is one creature</i>

97
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:45,590
<i>that limpets have no defence against.</i>

98
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,427
<i>A clingfish.</i>

99
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,641
<i>It has teeth
that can lever under the shell</i>

100
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,146
<i>and twist the limpet off
like a bottle top.</i>

101
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,486
<i>The clingfish then swallows it</i>

102
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,156
<i>shell and all.</i>

103
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:22,919
<i>Rock pool dramas like these
last just a few short hours</i>

104
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:25,463
<i>before the tide returns.</i>

105
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:34,972
<i>Every day the sea becomes land
and the land becomes sea.</i>

106
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,982
<i>Bringing new opportunities.</i>

107
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,572
<i>A Sally Lightfoot crab,</i>

108
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:59,247
<i>one of thousands of shore crabs
just waiting for their moment.</i>

109
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,712
<i>Every day they gather
on the tropical shores of Brazil,</i>

110
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:12,510
<i>waiting for the tide to go out.</i>

111
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:24,355
<i>Which exposes their feeding ground,</i>

112
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:29,277
<i>seaweed covered rocks,
a hundred metres from the shore.</i>

113
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:43,416
<i>Getting there is a race
against the tide.</i>

114
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:52,425
<i>They leap from rock to rock.</i>

115
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:10,443
<i>These crabs seem
to be afraid of the water.</i>

116
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:26,083
<i>And for good reason.</i>

117
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,264
<i>The Moray eel.</i>

118
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,645
<i>The chain Moray
is a specialist crab hunter.</i>

119
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,198
<i>It's blunt teeth can easily grip
and crush a crab's shell.</i>

120
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,456
<i>It's the crab's deadliest enemy.</i>

121
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,805
<i>But the crab's feeding grounds
are still a long way off.</i>

122
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,188
<i>They must press on.</i>

123
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,422
<i>Halfway.</i>

124
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,763
<i>But their enemy has other ideas.</i>

125
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,020
<i>Crossing the land</i>

126
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:19,530
<i>to reset the ambush.</i>

127
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:26,454
<i>To feed, the crabs must keep going.</i>

128
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,087
<i>But nowhere is safe.</i>

129
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,720
<i>An octopus. Also a crab killer.</i>

130
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,081
<i>The crabs make a dash for it.</i>

131
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,611
<i>Made it.</i>

132
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,872
<i>Risking life and limb</i>

133
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,501
<i>to graze on these seaweed pastures.</i>

134
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:03,050
<i>But in two hours' time
when the tide starts to turn,</i>

135
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,721
<i>they will have to run the gauntlet
all over again.</i>

136
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:22,069
<i>Tides are not the only force
to have an impact on the coast.</i>

137
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,552
<i>The greatest waves
originate far out to sea</i>

138
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:50,681
<i>and roll in towards the coast,
growing as they come.</i>

139
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:08,073
<i>As the shallowing sea floor
drags at their underside,</i>

140
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:12,036
<i>their crests rise
up to a hundred feet high,</i>

141
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,955
<i>topple over and break.</i>

142
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:25,966
<i>Many of the biggest surfed waves
in the world</i>

143
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,969
<i>are formed off Nazare in Portugal.</i>

144
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:49,865
<i>Every day along this coast,
the impact of the waves is equivalent</i>

145
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:54,078
<i>to one and a half million tonnes of TNT.</i>

146
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:21,814
<i>Wave power gradually moulds
and reshapes our coasts.</i>

147
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,361
<i>In some parts of Europe,</i>

148
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:32,533
<i>waves wear away as much as three metres
of coastline each year.</i>

149
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,460
<i>The rate at which the waves
reshape the rock</i>

150
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,546
<i>depends on its hardness.</i>

151
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,050
<i>Where soft rock lies below hard,</i>

152
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,386
<i>dramatic arches are craved.</i>

153
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,531
<i>It's an endless assault</i>

154
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:16,702
<i>that gradually sculpts
vaulted cathedrals of stone</i>

155
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,163
<i>as here in northern Spain.</i>

156
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,928
<i>And wave power
creates towering fortresses</i>

157
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:37,181
<i>like these cliffs in these Arctic,</i>

158
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:41,101
<i>home to tens of thousands
of breeding seabirds.</i>

159
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:50,194
<i>The faces of the cliffs
are accessible only from the air</i>

160
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:54,239
<i>and have plenty of nooks and crannies
for those that can get there.</i>

161
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:04,541
<i>But to feed, seabirds must still master
the ocean world beyond.</i>

162
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,048
<i>The puffin.</i>

163
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,595
<i>He's a fisherman...</i>

164
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,556
<i>...and a father.</i>

165
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,396
<i>He has a mate for life.</i>

166
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:37,866
<i>Both share the burden of raising
their week-old chick,</i>

167
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,162
<i>their puffling who needs
five square meals a day.</i>

168
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:48,001
<i>The parents alternate fishing trips.</i>

169
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,173
<i>It's dad's turn.</i>

170
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,991
<i>When fish stocks are low,</i>

171
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:23,287
<i>puffins must fly as much as 30 miles</i>

172
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,291
<i>to reach the good fishing grounds.</i>

173
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:43,974
<i>Once there,
they plunge into another world.</i>

174
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,820
<i>Good fishing spots are hard to come by,
and they have company.</i>

175
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,198
<i>Guillemots.</i>

176
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:11,835
<i>Like the puffin, their wings are short
and good for diving.</i>

177
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,883
<i>Puffins can hold their breath
for over a minute</i>

178
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,178
<i>and dive as deep as 40 metres.</i>

179
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,101
<i>A catch.</i>

180
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:50,874
<i>But it's a long way home.</i>

181
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:09,434
<i>After an exhausting round trip
of almost 60 miles,</i>

182
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,895
<i>this puffin's nearly made it.</i>

183
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,733
<i>But there are pirates on this coast.</i>

184
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,114
<i>Arctic Skuas.</i>

185
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:51,852
<i>All around returning parents
are being robbed.</i>

186
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:22,132
<i>The skuas' long rake back wings</i>

187
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:24,551
<i>make them faster and more manoeuvrable.</i>

188
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:07,552
<i>Puffins must choose their moment wisely.</i>

189
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,367
<i>A near miss.</i>

190
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,888
<i>A last desperate burst of speed,</i>

191
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,934
<i>and it's made it.</i>

192
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,591
<i>Safely home
after a three-hour round trip...</i>

193
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,934
<i>...where his patient partner is waiting.</i>

194
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,038
<i>Today their puffling will eat.</i>

195
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,964
<i>But where fish numbers are in decline,</i>

196
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:12,510
<i>many puffins now find it hard
to get enough food for their chicks.</i>

197
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,307
<i>In the changing seas of today,</i>

198
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:21,478
<i>it can be even harder
to be a successful puffin parent.</i>

199
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:37,035
<i>Overcoming the challenges
of two worlds is seldom easy.</i>

200
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:43,917
<i>One marine creature has virtually
abandoned the sea altogether.</i>

201
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,798
<i>On a few remote pacific islands,</i>

202
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:53,510
<i>lives the most terrestrial fish
on the planet.</i>

203
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:03,270
<i>At the top of this metre-high
limestone cliff,</i>

204
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,861
<i>an eight-centimetre long blenny
has chosen a nest hole.</i>

205
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:22,038
<i>Up here, he can graze
on the abundant algae</i>

206
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:25,375
<i>without any competition
from sea-going fish.</i>

207
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,546
<i>The females are feeding beneath him.</i>

208
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,553
<i>He's keen to attract their attention,</i>

209
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:42,559
<i>but they are busy moisturising.</i>

210
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,063
<i>Staying damp is essential
as they breathe through their skin.</i>

211
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:56,740
<i>To make himself conspicuous,
he turns black</i>

212
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,830
<i>and flashes his orange fin.</i>

213
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:07,417
<i>He catches her eye.</i>

214
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,256
<i>But these Pacific leaping blennies,</i>

215
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,092
<i>seem afraid of the waves.</i>

216
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,598
<i>They're poor swimmers</i>

217
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,851
<i>and will be easy prey in the sea.</i>

218
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,939
<i>Time to try again.</i>

219
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:34,944
<i>She's tempted.</i>

220
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,953
<i>But once again distracted by a wave.</i>

221
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,022
<i>The male just won't give up.</i>

222
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,745
<i>Finally, she's hooked.</i>

223
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,001
<i>He makes way...</i>

224
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:37,590
<i>so she can enter his cave.</i>

225
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,764
<i>And he encourages her to lay her eggs</i>

226
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,600
<i>with his seductive dance.</i>

227
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:06,953
<i>He then fertilizes them
in the safety of his nest.</i>

228
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:22,093
<i>The blenny has given up the sea
for a life on land.</i>

229
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:28,558
<i>Others have made
an even more successful move</i>

230
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:31,102
<i>but in a different direction.</i>

231
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,321
<i>Penguins have abandoned flying</i>

232
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,991
<i>and instead spend
most of their lives swimming.</i>

233
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,288
<i>Their sleek survival suits
of tightly packed feathers</i>

234
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:53,082
<i>are perfect for these freezing waters.</i>

235
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:58,171
<i>Yet, they must still come ashore
once a year.</i>

236
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:17,857
<i>South Georgia, an island wilderness
close to Antarctica.</i>

237
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:32,830
<i>Each spring, its beaches become
the busiest on Earth</i>

238
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,960
<i>as hundreds of thousands
of king penguins return here.</i>

239
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,013
<i>They're heading for the colony.</i>

240
00:39:56,354 --> 00:40:01,067
<i>But in their way lies the biggest wall
of blubber on the planet.</i>

241
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,490
<i>Elephant seals.</i>

242
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,667
<i>It's the breeding season</i>

243
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:22,755
<i>and the four-tonne bulls are fighting
for control of their harems.</i>

244
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,678
<i>Best to wait for them to calm down.</i>

245
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:46,613
<i>He can't fly over this barrier,</i>

246
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:50,783
<i>so he will have to walk
as unobtrusively as possible.</i>

247
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:58,958
<i>And hope that sleeping giants
will continue to lie.</i>

248
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,096
<i>Careful.</i>

249
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:33,242
<i>This could be tricky.</i>

250
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:54,472
<i>A rival bull mounts a challenge.</i>

251
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:59,769
<i>The penguins could be caught
in the crossfire.</i>

252
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:34,971
<i>Eight tonnes of blubber collide.</i>

253
00:42:56,993 --> 00:43:00,663
<i>The towering beach master is victorious.</i>

254
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:11,507
<i>In the confusion,
this penguin slips through.</i>

255
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:18,181
<i>Ahead are 40,000 chicks.</i>

256
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:24,353
<i>Hungry and over-excited.</i>

257
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,873
<i>But not every penguin
has a chick to feed.</i>

258
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:46,250
<i>That's not why they're here.</i>

259
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,423
<i>There is another reason.</i>

260
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:59,055
<i>There is a trial of endurance
that every penguin must face,</i>

261
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:04,393
<i>and it starts with a persistent itch.</i>

262
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:14,529
<i>His survival suit has been worn thin</i>

263
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:17,657
<i>by months of swimming
in the rough southern ocean.</i>

264
00:44:20,284 --> 00:44:22,286
<i>His solution is drastic.</i>

265
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:30,294
<i>Shed all four layers of feathers
as quickly as possible.</i>

266
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:39,345
<i>The process is known
as a catastrophic moult.</i>

267
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:48,104
<i>Until their feathers regrow,</i>

268
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:51,774
<i>penguins will remain rooted to the spot.</i>

269
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,717
<i>Having starved for a month,</i>

270
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:22,388
<i>they're now fully waterproofed
and insulated once more.</i>

271
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:43,993
<i>Lean, hungry and eager to return
to a life at sea.</i>

272
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:03,846
<i>Thanks to their waterproof plumage,</i>

273
00:46:04,013 --> 00:46:07,183
<i>penguins are able to make
the most of both worlds</i>

274
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:10,603
<i>even in some of the harshest conditions
on Earth.</i>

275
00:46:26,744 --> 00:46:28,371
<i>The coasts of South Georgia</i>

276
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:31,374
<i>are currently protected
by their remoteness.</i>

277
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:37,380
<i>Other coastlines
are much more vulnerable,</i>

278
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:46,097
<i>and they are now changing
faster than ever before.</i>

279
00:46:50,893 --> 00:46:55,314
<i>Two thirds of our major cities
are on our coasts.</i>

280
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:00,861
<i>It's estimated that in the next decade,</i>

281
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:05,658
<i>we can expect 10%
of the world's remaining wild shores</i>

282
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:08,828
<i>to be taken over by human development.</i>

283
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:21,674
<i>Yet every year,
just off Florida's Palm Beach</i>

284
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:26,595
<i>and extraordinary spectacle appears
almost unnoticed.</i>

285
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:37,648
<i>The biggest gathering of coastal sharks
on the planet.</i>

286
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:45,781
<i>Spinners and blacktips.</i>

287
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:52,705
<i>Ten thousand of them.</i>

288
00:48:03,466 --> 00:48:07,344
<i>Every January,
they seek out these warm shallows</i>

289
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:11,223
<i>as a stopover
on their migration northwards.</i>

290
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,860
<i>Sharks have been gathering here
since long before people arrived.</i>

291
00:48:34,163 --> 00:48:37,500
<i>But today, they face levels of pollution</i>

292
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:42,171
<i>and habitat degradation
as well as fishing pressures.</i>

293
00:48:42,338 --> 00:48:46,175
<i>that their ancestors
would never have experienced.</i>

294
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:53,307
<i>It's not longer enough
for coastal creatures</i>

295
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,851
<i>to master their own worlds.</i>

296
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:10,366
<i>Now they must face the many challenges
that come from our world, too.</i>

297
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:21,710
<i>Next time...</i>

298
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:26,966
<i>We travel the world to uncover
the biggest issues facing the ocean...</i>

299
00:49:30,219 --> 00:49:32,054
<i>meet the passionate people</i>

300
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:34,932
<i>who've devoted their lives
to protecting it</i>

301
00:49:36,392 --> 00:49:41,355
<i>and discover what the future holds
for our blue planet.</i>
