1
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,336
<i>In a far corner
of S oath-East Asia,</i>

2
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:45,297
<i>lies the Coral Triangle.</i>

3
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:52,721
<i>A cluster of the richest coral reefs,
in the world.</i>

4
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:02,564
<i>Undersea cities crammed full of life.</i>

5
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:12,074
<i>As in any crowded metropolis,</i>

6
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:15,410
<i>there is fierce rivalry for space,</i>

7
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,333
<i>for food</i>

8
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:27,714
<i>and for a partner.</i>

9
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:34,388
<i>But the reef is also a place
full of opportunity.</i>

10
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:49,361
<i>A cuttlefish.</i>

11
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:10,799
<i>It specialises in hunting crabs.</i>

12
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:23,103
<i>But a large crab is a dangerous quarry.</i>

13
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:33,488
<i>It has powerful claws.</i>

14
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:41,246
<i>The cuttlefish, however,
has a remarkable talent.</i>

15
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:50,797
<i>Its skin contains millions
of pigment cells</i>

16
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,592
<i>with which it can create
ever-changing colours</i>

17
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,010
<i>and patterns.</i>

18
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,857
<i>And that apparently hypnotises the crab.</i>

19
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,799
<i>A cuttlefish may be clever,</i>

20
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:35,967
<i>but a shark is bigger.</i>

21
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,889
<i>And it eats cuttlefish.</i>

22
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,394
<i>Time to disappear.</i>

23
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:03,829
<i>Back to the hunt.</i>

24
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:11,086
<i>A new target,
but the same mesmerising technique.</i>

25
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:32,357
<i>For those that manage to establish
themselves in these bustling</i>

26
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:33,900
<i>undersea cities,</i>

27
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:36,862
<i>there can be great rewards.</i>

28
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:01,219
<i>Corals build themselves
homes of limestone,</i>

29
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:04,723
<i>in the warm, clear,
shallow seas of the Tropics.</i>

30
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:11,646
<i>Their reefs occupy less than one tenth</i>

31
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,900
<i>of one percent of the ocean floor.</i>

32
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:21,406
<i>Yet, they're home to a quarter</i>

33
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,950
<i>of all known marine species.</i>

34
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,248
<i>They are complex,</i>

35
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:33,084
<i>infinitely variant structures,</i>

36
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:37,756
<i>providing all kinds of homes
for their many residents,</i>

37
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,511
<i>from penthouse suites,</i>

38
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,348
<i>to backstreet dens.</i>

39
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:55,440
<i>Here, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef,</i>

40
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:59,986
<i>a coral grouper lives
by hunting for small fish.</i>

41
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,827
<i>But how do you get a meal here,</i>

42
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,957
<i>when you're too big
to squeeze into crevices?</i>

43
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:24,511
<i>And the grouper also has a rival,</i>

44
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,351
<i>one which is highly intelligent,</i>

45
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:38,567
<i>and seeks the same kind of prey.</i>

46
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:42,821
<i>An octopus.</i>

47
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:08,930
<i>It can reach into really narrow cracks.</i>

48
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,024
<i>Even so,</i>

49
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,276
<i>its prey often escapes.</i>

50
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:35,790
<i>What if they could work together?</i>

51
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:54,893
<i>The grouper turns pale,</i>

52
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:02,651
<i>and tries to attract
the octopus's attention.</i>

53
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,116
<i>It performs a head stand.</i>

54
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,460
<i>Not only is the grouper signalling
to the octopus,</i>

55
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,797
<i>it's indicating
where the prey is hiding.</i>

56
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,979
<i>The octopus reaches inside.</i>

57
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,443
<i>The fish take fright.</i>

58
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:53,618
<i>And swim straight into
the grouper's jaws.</i>

59
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,295
<i>Sometimes, the octopus gets the reward,</i>

60
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:08,508
<i>sometimes, the grouper does.</i>

61
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,474
<i>Two very different species</i>

62
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:20,520
<i>have discovered
that teamwork can bring success,</i>

63
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:22,814
<i>in reef city.</i>

64
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:43,668
<i>Teamwork, in fact,
is the very foundation of life</i>

65
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,003
<i>on the reef.</i>

66
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:57,265
<i>The corals themselves
also rely on a partnership.</i>

67
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:02,103
<i>But one of a much more intimate kind.</i>

68
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,699
<i>Corals are colonies
of anemone-like animals,</i>

69
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:16,201
<i>polyps.</i>

70
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:20,121
<i>Some as small as grains of sand.</i>

71
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:25,919
<i>Living inside the tissues of each polyp,</i>

72
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:31,466
<i>are minute plant-like cells,
invisible to the naked eye.</i>

73
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:40,225
<i>By day flourishing in tropical sunshine,</i>

74
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,269
<i>the plant-like cells provide the polyps</i>

75
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,314
<i>with up to 90% of their food.</i>

76
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:03,331
<i>And when it's dark,
the polyps continue to feed</i>

77
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:09,254
<i>by using their tentacles to grab
edible particles drifting by.</i>

78
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,349
<i>The polyps also extract
calcium carbonate from the sea water,</i>

79
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:25,603
<i>and use it to build a stony housing
for themselves.</i>

80
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:32,443
<i>Coral colonies
can continue to grow for centuries.</i>

81
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,779
<i>Possibly millennia.</i>

82
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:43,329
<i>And they can build structures
that can reach the size of a house.</i>

83
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:02,640
<i>The biggest of their cities,
is the Great Barrier Reef.</i>

84
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:10,189
<i>It runs for over 7400 miles
along the coast of North East Australia.</i>

85
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:26,664
<i>Activity in coral reefs,
wherever they are, never ceases.</i>

86
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,544
<i>At dawn, the day shift begins.</i>

87
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:37,175
<i>Accompanied by a chorus
of submarine song,</i>

88
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:42,013
<i>created by fish, shrimps,
and other inhabitants of the reef.</i>

89
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:59,864
<i>Every resident in this city,
has its role.</i>

90
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,201
<i>Scavengers, like the sea cucumber,</i>

91
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,411
<i>recycle the waste of others.</i>

92
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,000
<i>These parrot fish,
bite off chunks of coral</i>

93
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:14,587
<i>and crunch it
to extract the contents.</i>

94
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:30,395
<i>And then, excrete the rest as sand.</i>

95
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:49,747
<i>Green turtles, here in Borneo,</i>

96
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:53,960
<i>pay regular visits
to a particular patch of coral.</i>

97
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,512
<i>This little female is up early
and one step ahead of the others.</i>

98
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:29,287
<i>Turtles travel long distances along
the reef in order to get here.</i>

99
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,376
<i>This is their destination.</i>

100
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,462
<i>Turtle Rock.</i>

101
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:48,973
<i>Generations of visiting turtles
have worn a hollow in its top.</i>

102
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:05,740
<i>This is home to blennies</i>

103
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,534
<i>and surgeon fish.</i>

104
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,249
<i>They clean the visitors picking off
any algae, parasites and dead skin,</i>

105
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,751
<i>that they can find.</i>

106
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,509
<i>Other client are close behind.</i>

107
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,727
<i>A queue is forming.</i>

108
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,622
<i>The big males barge their way in.</i>

109
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:14,559
<i>And the smaller female is forced out.</i>

110
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,404
<i>She takes a quick turn around the block,</i>

111
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,452
<i>while the others are squabbling.</i>

112
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,969
<i>And then, she sneaks back in.</i>

113
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:05,193
<i>So the cleaners get a nutritious meal,</i>

114
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,448
<i>and their customers are freed of
their parasites and other encumbrances.</i>

115
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:20,875
<i>And it's now thought, that a spot
of pampering at a cleaning station</i>

116
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,044
<i>may even reduce stress.</i>

117
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:43,314
<i>The lands of the Middle East
are so hot and dry,</i>

118
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,484
<i>that much of their surface
is almost lifeless.</i>

119
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,655
<i>But here in the Red Sea,</i>

120
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,532
<i>Coral Reefs flourish wonderfully.</i>

121
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:58,412
<i>The waters offshore,</i>

122
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,832
<i>are almost as rich
in life as a rainforest.</i>

123
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:07,255
<i>And some animals come to the reefs</i>

124
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:10,716
<i>simply for rest and relaxation.</i>

125
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,823
<i>The family of bottlenose dolphins</i>

126
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,366
<i>are resting on the reef</i>

127
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,286
<i>after a night's feeding offshore.</i>

128
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:02,143
<i>Whilst the adult and their babies sleep,</i>

129
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:07,231
<i>the adolescents set of the explore...</i>

130
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:13,904
<i>...and they appear to make up games.</i>

131
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,584
<i>You might call this one,
"Catch the coral."</i>

132
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,259
<i>The rules aren't entirely clear.</i>

133
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,613
<i>They pick up different bits
of broken coral,</i>

134
00:19:58,699 --> 00:19:59,992
<i>and drop them.</i>

135
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:04,038
<i>Some fall fast.</i>

136
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,127
<i>Others sink more slowly.</i>

137
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,898
<i>And some seem to be descending in a way</i>

138
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,525
<i>that pleases everybody.</i>

139
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:54,713
<i>Only the most successful city residents
can afford the luxury of playing games.</i>

140
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,885
<i>But, such games do that their value.</i>

141
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:04,181
<i>They may help the youngsters develop
the coordination and the agility</i>

142
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:08,352
<i>that they will need when
they start hunting in the open sea.</i>

143
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:24,034
<i>Every reef
has a sharply defined boundary.</i>

144
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,706
<i>Its city walls.</i>

145
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:37,381
<i>On the outer side is the drop off.</i>

146
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:42,136
<i>These ramparts protect the city
from the ocean waves.</i>

147
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:50,436
<i>But twice a day, the walls are covered
by the incoming tide.</i>

148
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:05,910
<i>In the Bahamas, the rush of the water
creates a truly strange phenomenon.</i>

149
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,967
<i>Seamen once told tales
of a giant sea monster,</i>

150
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,637
<i>lurking here deep inside the reef,</i>

151
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,265
<i>that would drag sailors to their doom.</i>

152
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:53,123
<i>Today, we know it is in fact a whirlpool
created by the incoming tide</i>

153
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,793
<i>rushing over deep coral caves.</i>

154
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,470
<i>These currents bring in fresh supplies
of microscopic food to the reef</i>

155
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,138
<i>from the open ocean.</i>

156
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:15,145
<i>And in the Maldives,
on the biggest tides,</i>

157
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,856
<i>one particular coral lagoon</i>

158
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,568
<i>become so flooded with plankton,</i>

159
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:26,156
<i>that it attracts hundreds
of ocean giants.</i>

160
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:30,828
<i>Manta Rays.</i>

161
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:35,040
<i>With three-metre wing spans.</i>

162
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:48,012
<i>With their huge sloth
like mouths wide open</i>

163
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,057
<i>they filter out the plankton.</i>

164
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:05,362
<i>And the mantas create
a vortex of their own</i>

165
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,198
<i>that further concentrates their food.</i>

166
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:57,581
<i>This behaviour has been called
the manta cyclone.</i>

167
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,928
<i>Then the tide changes,</i>

168
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:13,931
<i>and the supply of food is cut of.</i>

169
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,312
<i>The mantas leave the lagoon.</i>

170
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,119
<i>Life on the sheltered side of the reef
is tranquil and peaceful.</i>

171
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:43,794
<i>In these suburbs,
any creature wishing to escape</i>

172
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:46,547
<i>from the bustling crowds of reef city,</i>

173
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:49,800
<i>can find plenty of space.</i>

174
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,847
<i>On the other hand,</i>

175
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,057
<i>there is nowhere to hide.</i>

176
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,650
<i>That, at night,</i>

177
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,153
<i>makes it a dangerous place.</i>

178
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,663
<i>Nocturnal predators,
such as this lion fish,</i>

179
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,374
<i>patrol the reef edge.</i>

180
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,868
<i>The hunter has become the hunted.</i>

181
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,056
<i>A hobbit,</i>

182
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,727
<i>a giant carnivorous worm</i>

183
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,647
<i>with jaws as sharp as daggers.</i>

184
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:35,906
<i>It has an ancestry that stretches back
more than four hundred million years.</i>

185
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,166
<i>It's a metre long.</i>

186
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,774
<i>It tastes for scent.</i>

187
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:20,117
<i>And feels for movement.</i>

188
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:11,710
<i>Dawn, and with light,
the reef becomes a safer place.</i>

189
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,841
<i>Little bream return to foraging.</i>

190
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,686
<i>The bobbit might still be hungry.</i>

191
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,276
<i>But now in daylight
the odds have shifted.</i>

192
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,907
<i>The bream can see the bobbit.</i>

193
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,789
<i>Instead of retreating,</i>

194
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:54,044
<i>they join together to blow away
the sand covering the worm.</i>

195
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,388
<i>So, taking away
its advantage of surprise.</i>

196
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,729
<i>By revealing the [rabbit's hiding place,</i>

197
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:15,482
<i>they will all be able
to feed more safely.</i>

198
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,780
<i>But it pays to remember</i>

199
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,500
<i>there is a bobbit about.</i>

200
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,765
<i>Out here, on the sand flats,</i>

201
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,977
<i>there is safe accommodation for some.</i>

202
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:07,200
<i>The family of saddleback clownfish
have found an excellent home.</i>

203
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:13,790
<i>The tentacles
of this carpet anemone can kill.</i>

204
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,337
<i>But the clownfish
are immune to the poison,</i>

205
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:28,055
<i>so they can shelter from danger.</i>

206
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:37,814
<i>In return, the fish keep the anemone
clean of debris.</i>

207
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:44,529
<i>As with all clownfish,</i>

208
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:47,991
<i>the family is ruled by a big female.</i>

209
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:53,705
<i>Her white face marks her out
as the boss.</i>

210
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,922
<i>The diminutive male
has to prove his worth,</i>

211
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,716
<i>so he works tirelessly,</i>

212
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:09,012
<i>removing debris and generally keeping
on top of the housework.</i>

213
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:35,205
<i>His greatest challenge
is to find a safe place</i>

214
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,916
<i>where the boss can lay her eggs.</i>

215
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:44,923
<i>But there's nothing solid here
for the female to lay them on.</i>

216
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:53,640
<i>A nearby shell could be the solution.</i>

217
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,239
<i>If only he can move it
to the protection of the anemone.</i>

218
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:18,748
<i>Too heavy.</i>

219
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,755
<i>Besides, it has a mind of its own.</i>

220
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,261
<i>The hermit crab.</i>

221
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,023
<i>But out here, twice a day,</i>

222
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:47,110
<i>the anemone is swept by tidal currents,</i>

223
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:49,529
<i>and they bring in new opportunities.</i>

224
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,659
<i>An old plastic bottle.</i>

225
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:00,790
<i>Perhaps, this will do.</i>

226
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:10,467
<i>Not heavy enough.</i>

227
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,814
<i>A coconut shell.</i>

228
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,489
<i>It looks just right.</i>

229
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:35,825
<i>But it's a long way from home.</i>

230
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:58,056
<i>And he can't move it by himself.</i>

231
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,613
<i>So the pair now work together.</i>

232
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,909
<i>A little adjustment
to the anemone's tentacles,</i>

233
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,786
<i>in order to clear a space for it.</i>

234
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,250
<i>And the shell is tucked in.</i>

235
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,674
<i>The female lays.</i>

236
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,927
<i>A safe nursery at last.</i>

237
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:38,365
<i>He has proved himself worthy
to father her young.</i>

238
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,492
<i>And he fertilizes them.</i>

239
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,708
<i>Now he will meticulously tend the eggs,</i>

240
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,719
<i>keeping them clean
and healthy until they hatch</i>

241
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,555
<i>in 10 days time.</i>

242
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:22,659
<i>Reef creatures go to great lengths to
give their young a head start in life.</i>

243
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,837
<i>And nowhere more so</i>

244
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,507
<i>than on the remotest reefs in the world.</i>

245
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:41,719
<i>French Polynesia,</i>

246
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:45,056
<i>the very heart of the South Pacific.</i>

247
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:54,149
<i>Protected by their isolation,</i>

248
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:58,027
<i>some of the reefs here,
are still virtually pristine.</i>

249
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:13,543
<i>This marbled grouper has made it
in the city and reached adulthood.</i>

250
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,547
<i>Now, it's the time to mate.</i>

251
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:25,263
<i>To find a partner, he must head
to the most dangerous part of this reef:</i>

252
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:27,599
<i>The drop off.</i>

253
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:36,316
<i>Patrolled by grey reef sharks,</i>

254
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:40,820
<i>hundreds of them.</i>

255
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,662
<i>They seem to be resting,</i>

256
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,958
<i>for now.</i>

257
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:09,307
<i>Thousands of other groupers
have gathered on the seabed below.</i>

258
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:29,953
<i>The females are almost bursting
with eggs.</i>

259
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,459
<i>But to mate with one,</i>

260
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:41,548
<i>he must first get through the crowd
of other waiting males.</i>

261
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,387
<i>And they all have the same thing
on their minds.</i>

262
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:58,815
<i>They jostle to get as close as possible
to a female.</i>

263
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:30,680
<i>This male may have
secured pole position,</i>

264
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:35,268
<i>but the female won't release
her eggs for him to fertilize,</i>

265
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,354
<i>until conditions are just right.</i>

266
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:54,370
<i>Now the sharks begin to close in,</i>

267
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:58,958
<i>sensing that
the critical moment is approaching.</i>

268
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:29,572
<i>The tide is beginning to turn.</i>

269
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:35,286
<i>This could be the moment to spawn.</i>

270
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:47,423
<i>Suddenly, the females rush up
towards the surface</i>

271
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,259
<i>releasing their clouds
of eggs as they go.</i>

272
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:56,516
<i>The males pursue them,
simultaneously releasing their sperm.</i>

273
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:16,786
<i>It's an act
the groupers seem prepared to die for.</i>

274
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,460
<i>It's now or never.</i>

275
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:15,762
<i>The fertilized eggs,</i>

276
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:17,722
<i>will now be swept away</i>

277
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:22,518
<i>from the many hungry mouths
of the reef dwellers.</i>

278
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:38,117
<i>Most of the billions of eggs
that cloud the sea,</i>

279
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,702
<i>will be eaten.</i>

280
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:43,122
<i>But a few,</i>

281
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:45,541
<i>a tiny but crucial minority,</i>

282
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,252
<i>will find another reef</i>

283
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,588
<i>and make it their home.</i>

284
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:09,232
<i>But today's coral reefs
are facing a new threat.</i>

285
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:16,572
<i>The seas are warming.</i>

286
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:23,287
<i>A rise in temperature
of just one for two degrees</i>

287
00:44:23,788 --> 00:44:25,331
<i>for just a few weeks,</i>

288
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:31,921
<i>can be enough to cause the coral polyps
to eject their plant-like cells.</i>

289
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:44,183
<i>When that happens,
the corals lose both their colour,</i>

290
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:47,103
<i>and their main source of food.</i>

291
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:57,363
<i>If the high temperatures are sustained,</i>

292
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:00,616
<i>coral, bleached in this way,</i>

293
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:02,702
<i>is likely to die.</i>

294
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:13,880
<i>In recent years, it's thought that
half the world's coral reefs</i>

295
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:16,132
<i>have been affected by bleaching.</i>

296
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,559
<i>Including, since 2016,</i>

297
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:30,229
<i>around two thirds
of the shallow water corals,</i>

298
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:32,982
<i>on Australia's Great Barrier Reef.</i>

299
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:49,415
<i>These once crowded submarine cities,</i>

300
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,668
<i>are reduced</i>

301
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:54,837
<i>to bleak ruins.</i>

302
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,843
<i>and many of their inhabitants,
left homeless.</i>

303
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:20,404
<i>Some scientists predict
that by the end of the century,</i>

304
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:24,033
<i>coral reef cities as we know them,</i>

305
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:27,203
<i>could be a thing of the past.</i>

306
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:49,475
<i>Is there any future for these most
precious of ocean treasures?</i>

307
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:03,155
<i>Well, that ultimately depends
on how fast they heat up,</i>

308
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:05,783
<i>and how warm the seas become.</i>

309
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,914
<i>And there is a glimmer of hope,</i>

310
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:16,252
<i>because of the way
the corals reproduce themselves.</i>

311
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:25,594
<i>On one special night of the year,</i>

312
00:47:26,345 --> 00:47:30,433
<i>the full moon triggers
an extraordinary event:</i>

313
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,829
<i>The spawning of the coral.</i>

314
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,302
<i>With extraordinary synchrony,
entire reefs reproduce.</i>

315
00:48:23,152 --> 00:48:26,197
<i>Billions of fertilized eggs drift away</i>

316
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,702
<i>carried by the ocean currents.</i>

317
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:41,879
<i>And it's not just the corals that spawn,</i>

318
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:47,218
<i>so do many other residents of the reef.</i>

319
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:55,184
<i>A whole range of young</i>

320
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:57,520
<i>are swept through the oceans,</i>

321
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,065
<i>ready to settle on a vacant site,</i>

322
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:05,194
<i>and bring back into existence
the complex community,</i>

323
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:07,738
<i>that is a coral reef.</i>

324
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:24,088
<i>We may not know what the future
hold for our seas,</i>

325
00:49:27,383 --> 00:49:30,219
<i>but coral reefs can regenerate.</i>

326
00:49:30,928 --> 00:49:33,639
<i>As long as some reefs survive,</i>

327
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:38,102
<i>some hope can remain.</i>

328
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:55,161
<i>Next time, we head
into the vastness of the open ocean.</i>

329
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:02,293
<i>To survive in this blue wilderness,
some are fast,</i>

330
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:05,504
<i>others use deadly strategies,</i>

331
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:10,926
<i>and a few rely on the closeness
of their families.</i>
