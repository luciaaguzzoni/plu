1
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:38,957
<i>In the far north,</i>

2
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,045
<i>after three dark months of winter,</i>

3
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:51,637
<i>a world is waiting</i>

4
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:56,975
<i>for a trigger.</i>

5
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:02,147
<i>The sunshine of spring.</i>

6
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:18,080
<i>Starfish are the first to respond.</i>

7
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,177
<i>They race for the highest point,</i>

8
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:38,183
<i>and, sensing changes in the water,</i>

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,936
<i>with the tips of their tube feet,</i>

10
00:01:43,522 --> 00:01:44,856
<i>they spawn.</i>

11
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,582
<i>Sea cucumbers,</i>

12
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,043
<i>with only their mouths exposed,</i>

13
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:07,546
<i>HOW emerge.</i>

14
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:21,893
<i>They collect as many
starfish eggs as they can.</i>

15
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:40,412
<i>Which is quite a lot
when you've got ten arms.</i>

16
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,800
<i>Now sea pens</i>

17
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,969
<i>rise up to claim a share.</i>

18
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,106
<i>The creatures here</i>

19
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,777
<i>must grab what they can
of this annual banquet.</i>

20
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:19,117
<i>For the light has also set in motion,</i>

21
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:22,621
<i>the greatest transformation of all.</i>

22
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,626
<i>Fronds of kelp,</i>

23
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:30,796
<i>a marine alga, rise towards the surface,</i>

24
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,507
<i>lifted by their gas-filled bladders.</i>

25
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:50,649
<i>Soon, a marine forest has materialised.</i>

26
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:58,031
<i>Teeming with life of all kinds,</i>

27
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:05,372
<i>these green seas</i>

28
00:04:05,497 --> 00:04:09,751
<i>are some of the most productive
but fiercely competitive waters</i>

29
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,545
<i>in all the oceans.</i>

30
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:32,858
<i>The southern tip of Africa.</i>

31
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:39,239
<i>Here two great oceans collide.</i>

32
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:51,877
<i>In the shallows,</i>

33
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,379
<i>fed by rich currents,</i>

34
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:58,467
<i>are bountiful forests of kelp.</i>

35
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,692
<i>Barely visible, except for
the pulsating siphons</i>

36
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,068
<i>through which it breathes,</i>

37
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,282
<i>a common octopus waiting for prey
to pass by.</i>

38
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,122
<i>A crab will do.</i>

39
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:39,341
<i>The octopus sets off in pursuit.</i>

40
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,292
<i>And then lurks</i>

41
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:18,213
<i>with the patience of an ambush hunter.</i>

42
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,076
<i>But the octopus shares the Cape waters</i>

43
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:51,413
<i>with a great concentration
of other predators.</i>

44
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,755
<i>Fur seals,</i>

45
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,009
<i>and sharks.</i>

46
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,056
<i>They all eat octopus,</i>

47
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,059
<i>if they can find one.</i>

48
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:25,238
<i>And Pyjama Sharks are experts</i>

49
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,909
<i>at hunting in the undergrowth.</i>

50
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,713
<i>Time to disappear.</i>

51
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:50,347
<i>But these tough-skinned little sharks</i>

52
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,059
<i>are small enough to reach deep
into crevices.</i>

53
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,998
<i>But the octopus is far from finished.</i>

54
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:24,172
<i>She slips her tentacles
into the shark's gills.</i>

55
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,176
<i>That prevents the shark from breathing.</i>

56
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:34,974
<i>So the shark has to let go.</i>

57
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:50,448
<i>When caught out
in the open and vulnerable,</i>

58
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:54,661
<i>this octopus does something
truly extraordinary,</i>

59
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,373
<i>and never recorded before.</i>

60
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,511
<i>She disguises herself</i>

61
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:17,142
<i>with a protective armour of shells.</i>

62
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,732
<i>She's hiding</i>

63
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,484
<i>in plain sight.</i>

64
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,998
<i>The shark can sense its prey.</i>

65
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,431
<i>But the shells confuse it.</i>

66
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,858
<i>In a forest full of hungry mouths,</i>

67
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:11,696
<i>superior wits allow this octopus
to stay alive.</i>

68
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,710
<i>Forests of kelp</i>

69
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,589
<i>flourish in seasonal waters
around the globe,</i>

70
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:37,263
<i>particularly along the Pacific Coast
of North America.</i>

71
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:48,483
<i>Here, the biggest kelps of all</i>

72
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,735
<i>grow in vast forests,</i>

73
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,905
<i>stretching for hundreds of miles.</i>

74
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,745
<i>In some places,</i>

75
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:05,124
<i>the giant fronds rise up
to 60 metres tall.</i>

76
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,675
<i>The thickets they create</i>

77
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,593
<i>are crowded with life.</i>

78
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,939
<i>Competition here for space and food</i>

79
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,482
<i>is intense.</i>

80
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,039
<i>A challenging problem</i>

81
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,625
<i>for the Garibaldi fish.</i>

82
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,302
<i>He tends to his patch of seaweed</i>

83
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:00,179
<i>filled with tiny creatures that he eats.</i>

84
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,858
<i>As with most farmers,</i>

85
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,152
<i>his work never ends.</i>

86
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,827
<i>He removes snails and any other grazers</i>

87
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,913
<i>that come to eat his algae.</i>

88
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,517
<i>No matter how big they are.</i>

89
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:01,032
<i>He has to deal with pests of all kinds.</i>

90
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,454
<i>This can be the worst of them.</i>

91
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:11,918
<i>Sea urchins that can scrape off
every vestige of algae from a rock.</i>

92
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:15,463
<i>Its spines are needle sharp.</i>

93
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,886
<i>Somehow the Garibaldi must remove it.</i>

94
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,569
<i>But the problem with sea urchins</i>

95
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,494
<i>is that they just keep coming.</i>

96
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:05,680
<i>When evening arrives
and the light fades,</i>

97
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:09,600
<i>he has to stop.
He not only needs a rest,</i>

98
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,602
<i>he needs to hide.</i>

99
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,026
<i>Because at night,</i>

100
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:21,279
<i>predators prowl through these forests.</i>

101
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,493
<i>A Torpedo Ray,</i>

102
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,623
<i>capable of stunning its victim
with 45 volts of electricity.</i>

103
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:47,305
<i>While the Garibaldi hides,</i>

104
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,976
<i>the urchins can feed
without interruption.</i>

105
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,654
<i>The light returns,</i>

106
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:11,037
<i>and he finds his farm is once again</i>

107
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:12,497
<i>under attack.</i>

108
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,224
<i>Urchins like locusts,</i>

109
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,018
<i>have the ability to swarm</i>

110
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,945
<i>and this can be disastrous</i>

111
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,696
<i>not just for the Garibaldi,</i>

112
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,032
<i>but for the kelp forest itself.</i>

113
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:05,049
<i>All the vegetation is now under attack.</i>

114
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,249
<i>The urchins move through the forest</i>

115
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,585
<i>cutting through the kelp fronds</i>

116
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,255
<i>and leaving behind vast barrens.</i>

117
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,468
<i>These urchin armies</i>

118
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:51,762
<i>have felled many kelp forests</i>

119
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,765
<i>along the Pacific Coast
of North America.</i>

120
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,775
<i>But help is at hand.</i>

121
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,340
<i>Sea otters.</i>

122
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,390
<i>All other kinds of otters spend much
of their lives on land.</i>

123
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:40,019
<i>But sea otters rarely leave the water.</i>

124
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:46,067
<i>At first, a newly born pup</i>

125
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,236
<i>is not a very good swimmer.</i>

126
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:50,571
<i>So its mother spends hours</i>

127
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:53,407
<i>grooming its fur to make it buoyant.</i>

128
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:03,042
<i>But to provide her youngster with milk,</i>

129
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,752
<i>and keep herself warm</i>

130
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,507
<i>she must eat up to 50%
of her bodyweight every day.</i>

131
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:32,863
<i>She does that by eating shellfish.</i>

132
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:42,915
<i>And urchins are among a sea otter's
favourite delicacies.</i>

133
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:06,814
<i>In the past, sea otters were hunted
so intensively for their fur,</i>

134
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,275
<i>that they came close to extinction.</i>

135
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,906
<i>With them gone,</i>

136
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:19,410
<i>many kelp forests were replaced with</i>

137
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:21,495
<i>urchin barrens.</i>

138
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,592
<i>Today, sea otters are protected.</i>

139
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,014
<i>And as their numbers slowly return,</i>

140
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:43,934
<i>many of the kelp forests
are recovering too.</i>

141
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,912
<i>Now, in some remote places,</i>

142
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,789
<i>sea otters are so numerous,</i>

143
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,875
<i>they assemble in huge wafts.</i>

144
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,007
<i>Something that hasn't been seen</i>

145
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,051
<i>for over a century.</i>

146
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:04,390
<i>In the sun drenched
shallows off Australia,</i>

147
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:09,687
<i>kelp is replaced by the sea 's
only flowering plants,</i>

148
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,357
<i>sea grass.</i>

149
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:24,910
<i>The most extensive of these marine
grasslands</i>

150
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:29,206
<i>can stretch for over 3,000 square miles.</i>

151
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,597
<i>All across the Tropics,</i>

152
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,725
<i>they're patrolled by tiger sharks.</i>

153
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:55,900
<i>They can grow
up to five metres in length.</i>

154
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:05,242
<i>And have powerful crushing jaws.</i>

155
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:17,171
<i>Green turtles are their prey.</i>

156
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:26,347
<i>The turtles feed almost entirely
on sea grass.</i>

157
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:33,521
<i>A single one can consume
up to two kilos of it in a day.</i>

158
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,623
<i>But they can never rest easy.</i>

159
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:08,639
<i>Healthy turtles will keep well away
from an approaching shark.</i>

160
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:26,824
<i>And just by keeping the turtles
on the move,</i>

161
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:30,411
<i>the sharks prevent
any one patch of sea grass</i>

162
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,371
<i>from being overgrazed.</i>

163
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:41,255
<i>And that has benefits for us all.</i>

164
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,932
<i>A patch of sea grass</i>

165
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:57,062
<i>can absorb and store
55 times as much carbon dioxide</i>

166
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,774
<i>as the same area of a rainforest.</i>

167
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:09,116
<i>So the prairies and their sharks</i>

168
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,869
<i>are surprising allies in the fight</i>

169
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,038
<i>against a warming climate.</i>

170
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:27,092
<i>The struggle to survive
in our green seas</i>

171
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,762
<i>can have far reaching consequences.</i>

172
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,223
<i>Once a year,</i>

173
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,393
<i>one particular meadow in Australia,</i>

174
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:38,604
<i>is transformed.</i>

175
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,573
<i>Around the first full moon of winter,</i>

176
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,284
<i>an army materialises.</i>

177
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,414
<i>Spider crabs.</i>

178
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,677
<i>For the past year
they've been feeding in deeper waters.</i>

179
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:24,525
<i>Now, they march across
the sea grass plains.</i>

180
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:46,463
<i>Hundreds of thousands of them.</i>

181
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,641
<i>They clamber over one another</i>

182
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:06,483
<i>creating great mounds</i>

183
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,992
<i>nearly a hundred metres long.</i>

184
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,539
<i>They're not seeking mates</i>

185
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,875
<i>neither are they laying eggs.</i>

186
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,003
<i>They have come here in order</i>

187
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,005
<i>to grow.</i>

188
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:35,179
<i>Like all crabs, their bodies
are enclosed in a hard</i>

189
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,014
<i>unexpandable shell.</i>

190
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:43,020
<i>So to grow,
they have to break out of it.</i>

191
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:58,076
<i>And that allows the soft one
that has developed beneath</i>

192
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,536
<i>to expand.</i>

193
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,381
<i>It will take days
for the new shell to harden.</i>

194
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,813
<i>Its legs are so limp,</i>

195
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,940
<i>that they won't work properly.</i>

196
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,779
<i>The crab is unprotected</i>

197
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,948
<i>and in great danger.</i>

198
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,918
<i>A smooth stingray.</i>

199
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,841
<i>It's huge, about four metres long.</i>

200
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:59,847
<i>It wants a soft, freshly moulted crab</i>

201
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,099
<i>that will be easier to eat.</i>

202
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,540
<i>The crabs try to stick together.</i>

203
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,135
<i>But now, disturbed by the ray,</i>

204
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,511
<i>they're scattering.</i>

205
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:47,561
<i>A newly moulted crab</i>

206
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,356
<i>is too weak to keep up with the crowd.</i>

207
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,417
<i>The safest place is right
in the middle of the pile.</i>

208
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:15,047
<i>That is why they have
all assembled here.</i>

209
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,184
<i>There is safety in numbers.</i>

210
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,244
<i>But the vast majority
of the crabs escape.</i>

211
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,414
<i>And within the next few days,</i>

212
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,209
<i>they will be ready to return
to the depths,</i>

213
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,878
<i>and resume their lonely wanderings</i>

214
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:56,546
<i>in search of food.</i>

215
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,728
<i>This is no graveyard.</i>

216
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,776
<i>But the triumph
of a hundred thousand crabs,</i>

217
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,153
<i>successfully moulted.</i>

218
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:49,182
<i>The green seas of Southern Australia,</i>

219
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:53,437
<i>are particularly rich in such
spectacular assemblies.</i>

220
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:02,154
<i>But most of the creatures come together
for a very different reason,</i>

221
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:05,615
<i>to breed.</i>

222
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:11,705
<i>The giant cuttlefish.</i>

223
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:15,292
<i>The largest of all cuttlefish.</i>

224
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,969
<i>They live for just one or two years.</i>

225
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,645
<i>Now, as the Australian summer
draws to an end,</i>

226
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,149
<i>they have one last act to complete.</i>

227
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,030
<i>To find a mate.</i>

228
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:53,246
<i>But there are
over one hundred thousand males</i>

229
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,625
<i>competing for the arriving females</i>

230
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,168
<i>in this one bay.</i>

231
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,928
<i>Among them, a giant, a true goliath.</i>

232
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:11,264
<i>He probably weighs about ten kilos.</i>

233
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:17,896
<i>Bands of colour sweep across his skin.</i>

234
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,690
<i>That's how cuttlefish communicate.</i>

235
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:45,090
<i>This smaller male couldn't
possibly take him on.</i>

236
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:58,061
<i>Beside Goliath and under his protection,</i>

237
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:01,231
<i>a female who has just mated with him.</i>

238
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:08,071
<i>But other rivals are still interested.</i>

239
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:15,412
<i>It seems a small male
wouldn't stand a chance.</i>

240
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:20,584
<i>The female is now displaying
a white stripe</i>

241
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,295
<i>along her side nearest Goliath.</i>

242
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:30,343
<i>It's a clear signal that she no longer
wants to mate with him.</i>

243
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:39,519
<i>It's all the encouragement
that the little male needs.</i>

244
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,962
<i>He's going to have to use trickery.</i>

245
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,813
<i>He tones down his colours,</i>

246
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,192
<i>and tucks in his arms.</i>

247
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:32,656
<i>He's just the right size to mimic
a female.</i>

248
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,670
<i>Goliath is deceived.</i>

249
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:53,051
<i>The small male now
displays a white stripe,</i>

250
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,761
<i>just like the real female</i>

251
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,013
<i>to deter his advances.</i>

252
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,605
<i>He slips beside her.</i>

253
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,026
<i>And they mate.</i>

254
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,541
<i>By mating with multiple partners,</i>

255
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,713
<i>the female ensures
the greatest genetic diversity</i>

256
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:31,256
<i>for her young.</i>

257
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,389
<i>The sneaky male leaves,</i>

258
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,976
<i>his final act complete.</i>

259
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,901
<i>So even among giant cuttlefish,
it seems,</i>

260
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,157
<i>it's not all about size.</i>

261
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:11,504
<i>Other males
in these Australian green pastures,</i>

262
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:15,675
<i>take greater responsibility
for their young.</i>

263
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,687
<i>A Weedy Sea Dragon.</i>

264
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,196
<i>This is a male</i>

265
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:39,282
<i>and he's carrying a precious cargo.</i>

266
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,453
<i>While mating with the female,</i>

267
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,288
<i>he collected the eggs</i>

268
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:47,624
<i>and attached them to his underside.</i>

269
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:57,467
<i>Now, he's leaving the seaweed thickets</i>

270
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:02,972
<i>and travelling into more open waters</i>

271
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:06,059
<i>where elaborate camouflage
is less effective.</i>

272
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,654
<i>And there are many predators out here.</i>

273
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:44,514
<i>And this is what the fathers
risk their lives for.</i>

274
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:56,526
<i>Dense clouds of minute shrimp.</i>

275
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,198
<i>Mysids.</i>

276
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,578
<i>One of a sea dragon's favourite foods.</i>

277
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,383
<i>They're drawing other sea dragons
out here too.</i>

278
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,620
<i>Finally, it's time for the young
to break free.</i>

279
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:53,666
<i>But algae has grown over
these developing eggs.</i>

280
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,587
<i>And it risks smothering them.</i>

281
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:05,637
<i>Nonetheless, the babies are emerging.</i>

282
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,025
<i>They've hatched successfully.</i>

283
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:33,831
<i>The fathers return to the tangle of kelp</i>

284
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:36,209
<i>where they're virtually invisible.</i>

285
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:45,301
<i>While the young remain out here.</i>

286
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,516
<i>But they will grow quickly,</i>

287
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,812
<i>surrounded as they are
by their ideal food.</i>

288
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,701
<i>Vast numbers of the ocean's young fish,</i>

289
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,162
<i>start their lives in the green seas.</i>

290
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:24,757
<i>One of the richest nurseries of all,
are the mangrove forests.</i>

291
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:32,515
<i>Fringing the coastline of the Tropics,</i>

292
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:37,395
<i>they form a natural protective barrier
between land and sea,</i>

293
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:42,900
<i>and are some of the world's most
productive forests.</i>

294
00:40:56,706 --> 00:41:00,043
<i>Below the water,
their arching aerial roots</i>

295
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:01,753
<i>give them a firm footing.</i>

296
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,893
<i>Here there's abundant food
for baby fish.</i>

297
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:25,985
<i>While the tangled roots protect them
from bigger fish,</i>

298
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:29,405
<i>and other predators that haunt
the channels.</i>

299
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,856
<i>But in Northern Australia</i>

300
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:07,193
<i>with the receding tide,</i>

301
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:13,157
<i>the little fish are forced
to leave their shelter.</i>

302
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:20,998
<i>And now, they're vulnerable.</i>

303
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:12,216
<i>It's the most deadly assassin
in the green seas.</i>

304
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:22,852
<i>The Zebra Mantis Shrimp.</i>

305
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:26,939
<i>A male, almost 40 centimetres long.</i>

306
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,960
<i>But he's not hunting just for himself.</i>

307
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:56,886
<i>He's collecting food for his mate.</i>

308
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:02,558
<i>She may have been his partner
for 20 years.</i>

309
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,820
<i>She relies on him to bring her food.</i>

310
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:20,159
<i>And puts her energy
into her eggs instead.</i>

311
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:27,250
<i>In a world so full of food,</i>

312
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:29,836
<i>this would seem a sensible strategy.</i>

313
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:40,263
<i>But it's also a risky one.</i>

314
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,835
<i>Were her male to disappear,
she could starve.</i>

315
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,638
<i>Something has caught
this mate's attention.</i>

316
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,144
<i>Perhaps an irresistible odour</i>

317
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:31,522
<i>or a distant call.</i>

318
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:38,988
<i>Whatever the reason,
a male will leave his burrow</i>

319
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:42,158
<i>and his lifelong mate.</i>

320
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:53,252
<i>An even larger hole.</i>

321
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,434
<i>Females who have lost their mates</i>

322
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:11,103
<i>appear to send out distress signals</i>

323
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,606
<i>to call in a new male.</i>

324
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:22,365
<i>A larger female will produce more eggs.</i>

325
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:24,533
<i>So by mating with her,</i>

326
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,370
<i>he will father more offspring.</i>

327
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:36,379
<i>But infidelity comes at a price.</i>

328
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:43,970
<i>A larger partner demands more food.</i>

329
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:02,822
<i>The richer a sea,
the greater the competition.</i>

330
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,492
<i>And there is one green sea</i>

331
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:10,746
<i>that supports more life
than all the rest combined.</i>

332
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:17,253
<i>Unlike the mangrove forests
and the sea grass prairies,</i>

333
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:20,423
<i>its location is in the open seas,</i>

334
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:23,759
<i>and only temporary and unpredictable.</i>

335
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:32,768
<i>This greenness comes
not from rooted plants,</i>

336
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,274
<i>but from clouds of floating ones.</i>

337
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:51,829
<i>Billions of microscopic phytoplankton</i>

338
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:53,789
<i>are proliferating.</i>

339
00:47:59,712 --> 00:48:01,380
<i>And in such numbers,</i>

340
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:05,968
<i>that they fuel one
of the greatest feasts of all.</i>

341
00:48:15,144 --> 00:48:17,354
<i>Off America's Pacific Coast,</i>

342
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:22,943
<i>hundreds of common dolphins
are rushing to a banquet.</i>

343
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:35,164
<i>They're not the only ones homing in.</i>

344
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:40,419
<i>So are sea lions.</i>

345
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:49,678
<i>They're heading
for Monterey Bay, California,</i>

346
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:54,767
<i>where algal blooms have caused
an explosion,</i>

347
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:57,686
<i>in plankton feeders.</i>

348
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:01,857
<i>Anchovies,</i>

349
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:03,943
<i>millions of them.</i>

350
00:49:11,117 --> 00:49:14,245
<i>The dolphins herd the anchovies
towards the surface.</i>

351
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,545
<i>Sea birds and sea lions
take advantage of the shoals appearance.</i>

352
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:30,970
<i>It's a race to grab a share
before others arrive.</i>

353
00:49:51,782 --> 00:49:53,117
<i>Hump Back Whales,</i>

354
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:56,912
<i>hundreds of them.</i>

355
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:13,429
<i>With every upward lunge, they sieve
out up to a 100 kilos of fish.</i>

356
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:36,452
<i>They're claiming the biggest share
of one of the biggest feasts on earth.</i>

357
00:51:07,483 --> 00:51:09,985
<i>So crucial are these tiny plankton,</i>

358
00:51:10,361 --> 00:51:14,490
<i>that almost all marine life ultimately
depends upon them.</i>

359
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:29,380
<i>It's the green seas, not the blue</i>

360
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,842
<i>that are the basis of almost all life</i>

361
00:51:34,343 --> 00:51:36,387
<i>in the world's oceans.</i>

362
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:16,010
<i>Next time on Blue Planet II,</i>

363
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:20,097
<i>we meet the creatures
that live where two worlds collide.</i>

364
00:52:22,725 --> 00:52:28,147
<i>And discover how they cope with the
demands of the ever-changing coasts.</i>
