1
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,329
<i>Antarctica.</i>

2
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:44,963
<i>The coldest, the harshest,
and the most remote continent on Earth.</i>

3
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:56,808
<i>No human being has ever descended
into the depths that surround it...</i>

4
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:01,647
<i>...until now.</i>

5
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:14,326
<i>The deep ocean is as
challenging to explore as space.</i>

6
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,082
<i>We know more about the surface of Mars</i>

7
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,210
<i>than we do about
the deepest parts of our seas.</i>

8
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,697
<i>Now we can dive
these uncharted depths,</i>

9
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,283
<i>to discover what secrets lie beneath.</i>

10
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:35,115
<i>Sinking down beside
the submerged wall of an iceberg,</i>

11
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,909
<i>we enter an unforgiving world.</i>

12
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:52,007
<i>These waters
are the coldest on Earth.</i>

13
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:58,889
<i>As we descend into the deep,</i>

14
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:01,850
<i>the pressure increases relentlessly.</i>

15
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:23,205
<i>And the light from above
all but disappears.</i>

16
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,464
<i>Yet, incredibly...</i>

17
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:38,637
<i>there is life here.</i>

18
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,494
<i>We might have expected</i>

19
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,747
<i>that deep beneath
the surface of the Polar seas,</i>

20
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:09,835
<i>the waters would be truly barren.</i>

21
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:22,556
<i>But, in fact, we find life here
in unimaginable abundance.</i>

22
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:41,741
<i>Nor is such great abundance
confined to Antarctic waters.</i>

23
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,289
<i>Currents carry this richness</i>

24
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:51,543
<i>into the depths of almost
every ocean around the world.</i>

25
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:58,216
<i>Astonishingly, in the deep sea,</i>

26
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,220
<i>there is more life
than anywhere else on Earth.</i>

27
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,834
<i>The sunlight fades,</i>

28
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,961
<i>and the seas darken.</i>

29
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:42,260
<i>Here, in the Pacific, 200 metres down,</i>

30
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:45,180
<i>we enter an alien world.</i>

31
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,060
<i>The Twilight Zone,</i>

32
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,979
<i>a sea of eternal gloom.</i>

33
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:03,323
<i>There are strange creatures here.</i>

34
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,284
<i>A pyrosome.</i>

35
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:12,666
<i>A tube of jelly two metres long
that dwarfs a visitor from above,</i>

36
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:16,002
<i>an oceanic whitetip shark.</i>

37
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,224
<i>Only a tiny amount of light
filters down this far.</i>

38
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:39,234
<i>Survival here means making the most
of every last glimmer.</i>

39
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:49,995
<i>A swordfish.</i>

40
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:04,843
<i>Its eyes are as big as tennis balls
to help it see in the perpetual dusk.</i>

41
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,394
<i>A squid, but this is one
that lives only here.</i>

42
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,065
<i>Its right eye
looks permanently downwards.</i>

43
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:24,779
<i>But its left eye is much bigger
and trained upwards</i>

44
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:29,034
<i>to detect the silhouettes of prey
swimming nearer the surface.</i>

45
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:34,623
<i>No wonder it's nicknamed
the "cock-eyed squid".</i>

46
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,256
<i>And even stranger,</i>

47
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,886
<i>this is barreleye,</i>

48
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,642
<i>a fish with a transparent head,</i>

49
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,311
<i>filled with jelly,</i>

50
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:59,564
<i>so that it can look up
through its skull.</i>

51
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:20,627
<i>We now know that
the Twilight Zone is a refuge</i>

52
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:25,757
<i>for an incredible 90%
of all fish in the ocean.</i>

53
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:36,017
<i>Only at night,
do vast shoals of lanternfish</i>

54
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:40,271
<i>migrate to the surface
to feed on tiny plankton.</i>

55
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,953
<i>By day, they retreat back down here.</i>

56
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,012
<i>Humboldt squid.</i>

57
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,862
<i>Two metres long
and 50 kilos in weight.</i>

58
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:37,662
<i>Like most squid,
they're voracious hunters.</i>

59
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,338
<i>There are hundreds of them.</i>

60
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,269
<i>They found a shoal of lanternfish</i>

61
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:05,356
<i>hiding 800 metres down,
off the coast of South America.</i>

62
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:21,206
<i>Their tentacles are armed
with powerful suckers</i>

63
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,416
<i>with which they grab their prey.</i>

64
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,478
<i>And when there are
no more lanternfish to be found,</i>

65
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:47,899
<i>they turn on each other.</i>

66
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:03,081
<i>This squid has caught
a smaller one in its tentacles.</i>

67
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,088
<i>To hide its capture from the rest,</i>

68
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,924
<i>it releases a smokescreen of black ink.</i>

69
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:29,315
<i>But then, an even
bigger one challenges it</i>

70
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,616
<i>and steals its catch.</i>

71
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,168
<i>The Twilight Zone</i>

72
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:52,380
<i>is the Humboldt squid's
favourite hunting ground.</i>

73
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,800
<i>They seldom go deeper</i>

74
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:00,805
<i>into the world
of perpetual blackness below.</i>

75
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,229
<i>The Midnight Zone.</i>

76
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:22,118
<i>Two-thirds of
a mile from the surface,</i>

77
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,495
<i>beyond the reach of the sun.</i>

78
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,503
<i>A giant black void</i>

79
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:36,549
<i>larger than all the rest
of the world's habitat's combined.</i>

80
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,681
<i>There's life here,</i>

81
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,018
<i>but not as we know it.</i>

82
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,281
<i>Alien-like creatures</i>

83
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:03,242
<i>produce dazzling displays of light.</i>

84
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,300
<i>Nearly all animals
need to attract mates</i>

85
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:20,927
<i>and repel predators.</i>

86
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:27,433
<i>This language of light
is so widespread here,</i>

87
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:32,105
<i>that these signals are probably
the commonest form of communication</i>

88
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:34,899
<i>on the entire planet.</i>

89
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:39,112
<i>And yet,
we still know little about them.</i>

90
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,305
<i>Hunters illuminate themselves,</i>

91
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,807
<i>and by doing so</i>

92
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,309
<i>attract inquisitive prey.</i>

93
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,366
<i>This is fangtooth.</i>

94
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:31,205
<i>It has the largest teeth
for its size of any fish.</i>

95
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,378
<i>There are pressure sensors
all over its head and body</i>

96
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:41,007
<i>which can detect anything
moving in the surrounding water.</i>

97
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:51,642
<i>It's the Midnight Zone's
most voracious fish.</i>

98
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:57,023
<i>But prey use light as a distraction.</i>

99
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:04,822
<i>A decoy of luminous ink.</i>

100
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,709
<i>Down here, in this blackness,</i>

101
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:22,548
<i>creatures live beyond
the normal rules of time.</i>

102
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,934
<i>Siphonophores are virtually eternal.</i>

103
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:36,938
<i>They repeatedly clone themselves,</i>

104
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:40,942
<i>some eventually growing
longer than a blue whale.</i>

105
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:09,095
<i>Down here, it snows.</i>

106
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:20,606
<i>Continuous clouds of organic debris</i>

107
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,442
<i>drift slowly down from above.</i>

108
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:33,119
<i>This is food,</i>

109
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:37,415
<i>and a whole variety
of filter feeders depend on it.</i>

110
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,961
<i>Jellyfish.</i>

111
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,598
<i>And delicate sea cucumbers.</i>

112
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:16,120
<i>The 1% of marine snow they miss</i>

113
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,457
<i>eventually settles on the sea floor.</i>

114
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,071
<i>Over millions of years,</i>

115
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:54,867
<i>it forms a layer of mud
up to a mile thick.</i>

116
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,165
<i>It's an empty plain</i>

117
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:04,252
<i>that covers half
the surface of our planet.</i>

118
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:35,533
<i>The deep seabed may,
at first, appear lifeless,</i>

119
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:42,373
<i>but it's home to a unique
cast of mud dwellers.</i>

120
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:46,711
<i>The sea toad.</i>

121
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:53,634
<i>It is an ambush predator
with an enormous mouth</i>

122
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,722
<i>and infinite patience.</i>

123
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:12,236
<i>This fish has been
living for so long here</i>

124
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,823
<i>that its fins have changed
into something more useful.</i>

125
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:23,581
<i>Feet.</i>

126
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,922
<i>They help it shuffle about
on the sea floor.</i>

127
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,446
<i>The flapjack octopus.</i>

128
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:03,079
<i>It hovers just above
the surface of the mud</i>

129
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:07,291
<i>as it delicately sifts through it
searching for worms.</i>

130
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:14,965
<i>But it can jet away
at the first sign of danger.</i>

131
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,488
<i>A sixgill shark,
as big as a great white.</i>

132
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:42,701
<i>It may not have eaten
for an entire year.</i>

133
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,502
<i>It patrols the mud plains</i>

134
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,380
<i>using a minimum amount of energy.</i>

135
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,728
<i>High above,</i>

136
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:12,398
<i>the carcass of a huge sperm whale</i>

137
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,692
<i>is slowly decaying.</i>

138
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:24,702
<i>This will be a bonanza
for the creatures of the deep.</i>

139
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,037
<i>Food.</i>

140
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,290
<i>Thirty tonnes of it.</i>

141
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:46,974
<i>Finally it settles on the ocean floor</i>

142
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,729
<i>and its presence is soon detected.</i>

143
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,324
<i>Sixgills sharks</i>

144
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,285
<i>have an exceptionally
acute sense of smell.</i>

145
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:15,419
<i>just 25 minutes
after the whale's carcass arrives,</i>

146
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,590
<i>a sixgill finds it.</i>

147
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,032
<i>Each bite releases
blood into the current.</i>

148
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:31,662
<i>The news that food
is here spreads quickly.</i>

149
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,841
<i>Two more ravenous sixgills arrive.</i>

150
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,478
<i>Within 12 hours,
there are seven enormous sharks</i>

151
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,105
<i>jostling with one another</i>

152
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,025
<i>as they compete to tear off mouthfuls.</i>

153
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:16,081
<i>No one is prepared to back off.</i>

154
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,795
<i>Twenty-four hours later,</i>

155
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,923
<i>and a third of the carcass has gone.</i>

156
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,541
<i>The first arrival has gorged</i>

157
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,668
<i>until it's completely full.</i>

158
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,466
<i>This single meal</i>

159
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,220
<i>may be enough to sustain it
for a whole year.</i>

160
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:03,021
<i>Now, the clean up team arrives.</i>

161
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,695
<i>Spider crabs carrying coral
in their hind legs,</i>

162
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,407
<i>presumably as makeshift body armour.</i>

163
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:24,001
<i>There are rock crabs here too.</i>

164
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:31,008
<i>They probably detected the carcass
almost as soon as the sharks,</i>

165
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,595
<i>but they can't move as fast.</i>

166
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:42,811
<i>A month on,
and over 30 species of scavenger</i>

167
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:46,273
<i>are clearing away
the last edible fragments.</i>

168
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:52,905
<i>But now, the scavengers
are attracting their own predators.</i>

169
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,706
<i>Scabbardfish, habitually
swimming upright,</i>

170
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,250
<i>are picking them off one by one.</i>

171
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,566
<i>Some of the whale's teeth
have been dislodged</i>

172
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,402
<i>as the skeleton starts to fall apart.</i>

173
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:40,911
<i>Four months later,
there is nothing left but a few bones.</i>

174
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,754
<i>But even they are food</i>

175
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,468
<i>for something.</i>

176
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,310
<i>Zombie worms.</i>

177
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:13,110
<i>They tunnel into the bones
by injecting acid</i>

178
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:18,115
<i>and so reach the tiny amounts of fat
that still remain there.</i>

179
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,119
<i>It may take decades,</i>

180
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:26,373
<i>but eventually,
the last of the bones will crumble,</i>

181
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:31,128
<i>and the whole 50-tonne carcass
will have been recycled.</i>

182
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,889
<i>A whale fall is a temporary oasis</i>

183
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,057
<i>in the desert of the sea floor.</i>

184
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,397
<i>But there are permanent oases here too.</i>

185
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:07,623
<i>Rocks projecting above the mud</i>

186
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:11,168
<i>provide anchorage for deep sea corals.</i>

187
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:33,690
<i>As far down
as three and a half miles,</i>

188
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,693
<i>there are more species of coral
in the deep</i>

189
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,363
<i>than on shallow tropical reefs.</i>

190
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:52,292
<i>Without sunlight,
they rely solely on food</i>

191
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,044
<i>drifting in the current.</i>

192
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,049
<i>And they grow</i>

193
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:02,552
<i>just a hair's breadth a year.</i>

194
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:12,229
<i>But some of them
can live for 4,000 years.</i>

195
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:22,239
<i>They, like their
shallow water relatives,</i>

196
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:25,909
<i>provide homes for all kinds
of other creatures.</i>

197
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,229
<i>Growing among the corals,</i>

198
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:57,149
<i>is one of the most beautiful of sponges.</i>

199
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,614
<i>This is Venus' flower basket.</i>

200
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,541
<i>These sponges have lodgers.</i>

201
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,710
<i>Shrimps.</i>

202
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,846
<i>There are plenty
of predators on the reef</i>

203
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:30,307
<i>so the shrimps are fortunate.</i>

204
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:37,022
<i>Both this male and female,</i>

205
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:40,317
<i>were swept into this sponge
when they were tiny larvae,</i>

206
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,361
<i>along with the minute particles of food</i>

207
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,489
<i>on which the sponge feeds.</i>

208
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:53,538
<i>They found each other
and have been here ever since.</i>

209
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,056
<i>Now, they're full-grown</i>

210
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,767
<i>and the female is carrying eggs.</i>

211
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:31,535
<i>Once hatched, the larvae will swim
out through the sponge's walls.</i>

212
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,752
<i>But the shrimps will never leave.</i>

213
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:43,296
<i>They can't.</i>

214
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:54,057
<i>They're now far too big
to go out the way they came in.</i>

215
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,893
<i>And, no doubt,
they will live longer here</i>

216
00:32:56,977 --> 00:33:01,731
<i>than they would if they were
wandering about on the reef unprotected.</i>

217
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:18,248
<i>But how one
of the simplest of all animals,</i>

218
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:23,086
<i>a sponge, is able to build
such a complex structure</i>

219
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,589
<i>to the great benefit of the shrimps</i>

220
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,592
<i>is a mystery.</i>

221
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,928
<i>And, surely, a marvel.</i>

222
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:50,322
<i>But today,</i>

223
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:54,367
<i>their timeless world
is being reduced to rubble.</i>

224
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:07,464
<i>As over-fishing empties
the surface waters of the seas,</i>

225
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:11,134
<i>trawlers have started
to ransack the deep.</i>

226
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:17,390
<i>Now, countless numbers of the reefs</i>

227
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,018
<i>that have flourished here for millennia</i>

228
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,145
<i>lie in ruins.</i>

229
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:53,927
<i>Over time,</i>

230
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,722
<i>organic matter on the sea floor
slowly decays</i>

231
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,016
<i>producing methane.</i>

232
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,541
<i>In the Gulf of Mexico,</i>

233
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:10,628
<i>these eruptions also release
a super salty liquid.</i>

234
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,263
<i>Brine.</i>

235
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,611
<i>Five times heavier than sea water,</i>

236
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:38,656
<i>it accumulates in great pools
on the sea floor.</i>

237
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:47,457
<i>It's difficult to make sense
of the sight.</i>

238
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:58,009
<i>A lake of concentrated salt water,</i>

239
00:36:58,134 --> 00:36:59,969
<i>fifteen metres deep,</i>

240
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:02,680
<i>at the bottom of the sea.</i>

241
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:14,567
<i>Around its margin,
perhaps even more strangely,</i>

242
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,320
<i>there is a profusion of life.</i>

243
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:28,873
<i>Giant mussels that can live
or grow for a century or more,</i>

244
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,583
<i>pack tightly together,</i>

245
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:34,838
<i>dwarfing the shrimps and squat lobsters
that feed around them.</i>

246
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,954
<i>Cutthroat eels, scavengers,</i>

247
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,373
<i>come to the shores of the brine lake</i>

248
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,375
<i>in search of something edible.</i>

249
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:24,262
<i>Some even venture into the brine.</i>

250
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,760
<i>Spending too long in it
can send an eel into toxic shock.</i>

251
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:19,150
<i>It' only hope
is to rise above it.</i>

252
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:36,000
<i>It manages to escape.</i>

253
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,470
<i>Others are not so lucky.</i>

254
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,564
<i>The brine embalms their bodies,</i>

255
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:04,696
<i>and the casualties of decades
accumulate around the margins.</i>

256
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:29,178
<i>But parts of the deep
are even more hostile.</i>

257
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,187
<i>In places,</i>

258
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:43,359
<i>gigantic cracks stretch for many miles
across the ocean floor.</i>

259
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:02,879
<i>Canyons that plunge
towards the centre of the earth.</i>

260
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,722
<i>Scans from survey vessels</i>

261
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:16,434
<i>make it possible to graphically
reconstruct an image</i>

262
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,145
<i>of this vast submarine landscape.</i>

263
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,406
<i>The deepest of all,
at almost seven miles,</i>

264
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,493
<i>is the Mariana Trench
in the Pacific Ocean.</i>

265
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:43,252
<i>Even Mount Everest
could disappear inside it.</i>

266
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:02,397
<i>Down here, in these deep ravines,</i>

267
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,984
<i>it was once thought that
nothing whatever could possibly survive.</i>

268
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,869
<i>But there is life even here.</i>

269
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,545
<i>A kind of sea slug.</i>

270
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:35,805
<i>A so-called sea pig.</i>

271
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,184
<i>They, and other simple creatures,</i>

272
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:45,732
<i>manage to survive on the minuscule
amount of food that drifts down here.</i>

273
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:50,945
<i>Like this starfish,</i>

274
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:55,199
<i>they can withstand pressure
equivalent of 50 jumbo jets</i>

275
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,577
<i>stacked on top of one another.</i>

276
00:43:19,557 --> 00:43:21,434
<i>A remote camera probe</i>

277
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:25,062
<i>reveals the most
extraordinary discovery of all.</i>

278
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,948
<i>The ethereal snailfish.</i>

279
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:41,829
<i>At five miles down,</i>

280
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:46,042
<i>this is the deepest living fish
so far discovered.</i>

281
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:54,050
<i>No one imagined</i>

282
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:57,136
<i>than an animal as complex as a fish</i>

283
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,389
<i>could exist in such extreme pressures.</i>

284
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:14,695
<i>From the greatest depths</i>

285
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:17,782
<i>to the uppermost limit
of the Twilight Zone,</i>

286
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:21,285
<i>it seems that there is
nowhere in the deep sea</i>

287
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,330
<i>where life of some kind can't survive.</i>

288
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:30,336
<i>And we now think</i>

289
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:34,131
<i>that the deep sea may well be
where life on Earth began.</i>

290
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:49,730
<i>Here,</i>

291
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:54,777
<i>in a world hidden within the greatest
geological feature on Earth,</i>

292
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:01,784
<i>running right down the middle
of the world's oceans,</i>

293
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:04,287
<i>an underwater mountain range</i>

294
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,622
<i>spanning the entire globe.</i>

295
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:13,713
<i>The mid-ocean ridge.</i>

296
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,937
<i>In the South Pacific,</i>

297
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:32,982
<i>the ocean floor is being torn apart.</i>

298
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:51,686
<i>Over three quarters
of the planet's volcanic activity</i>

299
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:54,063
<i>occurs in the deep.</i>

300
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,949
<i>Almost all of it along
the mid-ocean ridge.</i>

301
00:47:09,078 --> 00:47:11,956
<i>But from this titanic violence</i>

302
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:14,083
<i>come great riches.</i>

303
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:27,096
<i>Gases and scalding water
gush up through the crevices.</i>

304
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:39,358
<i>Minerals condensing from these jets</i>

305
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:41,360
<i>build up great chimneys.</i>

306
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:44,780
<i>Hydrothermal vents.</i>

307
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:51,162
<i>This one, 30 metres tall,</i>

308
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,330
<i>has been named "Godzilla</i>

309
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:04,425
<i>Astonishingly, we now know</i>

310
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:08,679
<i>that they hold as much life
as tropical rainforests.</i>

311
00:48:16,729 --> 00:48:20,649
<i>In places, half a million
individual animals</i>

312
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:23,736
<i>are crammed into a single square metre.</i>

313
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:40,419
<i>They depend entirely
for their food on bacteria.</i>

314
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:45,382
<i>And they feed on chemicals</i>

315
00:48:45,508 --> 00:48:48,260
<i>dissolved in the searingly hot fluid.</i>

316
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:58,979
<i>Crabs consume the bacterial mats</i>

317
00:48:59,063 --> 00:49:01,065
<i>that coat their shells.</i>

318
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:17,915
<i>Others maintain
bacterial cultures,</i>

319
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,584
<i>actually within their bodies.</i>

320
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:30,886
<i>Shrimps carry such cultures
in their mouth parts.</i>

321
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:34,557
<i>But that is a strategy
fraught with danger.</i>

322
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:43,315
<i>To provide sustenance
for these microbes,</i>

323
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:46,735
<i>the shrimps must dash
into the hot vents,</i>

324
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:51,991
<i>and that risks being boiled alive.</i>

325
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:07,631
<i>In the last decade,</i>

326
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:11,802
<i>the number of hydrothermal vents
discovered has doubled.</i>

327
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:24,356
<i>Every one has its own unique
character and community.</i>

328
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:35,451
<i>But, perhaps, the most important
one of all is in the Atlantic.</i>

329
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:40,623
<i>It has been named "The Lost City".</i>

330
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,962
<i>Within its 60-metre towers,</i>

331
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:50,716
<i>something truly extraordinary
is taking place.</i>

332
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:57,514
<i>Under extremes
of pressure and temperature,</i>

333
00:50:57,806 --> 00:50:59,725
<i>hydrocarbons,</i>

334
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:04,313
<i>the molecules that are the basic
component of all living things,</i>

335
00:51:05,147 --> 00:51:08,359
<i>are being created spontaneously.</i>

336
00:51:20,037 --> 00:51:23,457
<i>Indeed, many scientists now believe</i>

337
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:29,380
<i>that life on Earth
may have begun around a vent like this</i>

338
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,091
<i>four billion years ago.</i>

339
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,738
<i>We now know
that there are deep seas</i>

340
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:58,033
<i>on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.</i>

341
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:09,878
<i>If life can exist under
such extreme conditions down here,</i>

342
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:14,800
<i>then surely it could exist
somewhere out there.</i>

343
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:31,066
<i>Next time, we travel
to bustling coral reefs.</i>

344
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:42,119
<i>Here, animals must go
to extraordinary lengths</i>

345
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:47,499
<i>to get ahead of the competition
in these crowded cities.</i>
